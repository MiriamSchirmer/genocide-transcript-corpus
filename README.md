<h2>Genocide Transcript Corpus (GTC)</h2>

The Genocide Transcript Corpus (GTC) provides transcript data from three different genocide tribunals: the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). 

All  samples  were  labeled  according  to  whether  they contain a witnessâ€™s description of experienced violence. Violence in this context includes accounts of experienced torture, interrogation, death, beating, psychological violence, experienced military attacks, destruction of villages, and looting. 

The transcript data was divided into equally large text chunks of 250 words each. Numbers  and  punctuation  were  removed.
