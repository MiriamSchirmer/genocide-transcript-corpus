decision on the removal of witnesses from the witness list   The Chamber wishes to inform the parties and the public about issues discussed at the trial management meeting on the afternoon of the rd of June and subsequent decisions In order to ensure the conduct of a fair and expeditious trial the Chamber reviewed the list of witnesses with a view to reducing the number called to testify in person Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page After observing the evolution of the proceedings and at the trial management meeting the Trial Chamber after reviewing the progress in the trial to date proposed removing a number of witnesses from the witness list clarifying that it will put before the Court a statement of those witnesses who were heard before the ECCC during the investigative phase The Chamber sought the views of the parties on this proposal and enquired whether they wished any of these witnesses to be heard in person The CoProsecutors did not comment on individual witnesses but suggested that a reserve list of witnesses be retained for consideration at a later stage Civil party groups and supported the CoProsecutors decision Civil party group asked to hear witnesses KW KW KW KW KW and KW in person but failed to give reasons for the request Civil party group requested to hear witnesses KW KW KW CP KW CP and CP  ;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
The defence agreed with the Chambers proposal with the exception of the suggestion to remove Raoul Marc Jennar from the list The Chamber notes that the defence did not seek the presence of any of these witnesses for the purpose of confrontation In summary reasons given by the parties are KW was in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page special unit and made arrests and the Chinese were involved The accused has contested that this unit made arrests KW would testify that the accused conducted interrogations personally in particular on foreigners and important prisoners This is contested by the accused KW would testify about meetings between the accused and the upper echelon asserting that this is contested by the accused CP would testify about visits of the accused to Choeung Ek Again this situation is that this is contested by the accused KW would testify that the accused ordered arrests and torture after which would demonstrate that his claim that he hated this work and was fearful for his fate is not credible CP would testify about the conditions of staff and forced marriages at S CP would testify about direct communication between the accused and Division and give evidence about the time after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime   Raoul Marc Jennar is a researcher of the crimes during the Democratic Kampuchea period and has visited prisons He would;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
therefore be in a position to compare them with S In addition it would be unfair not to let the defence call an expert to give testimony The decisions The Chamber notes that during the trial management meeting no Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page party objected to the removal from the witness list of the following witnesses and to their written statements made before the ECCC during the investigating phase being put before the Court pursuant to Rule   In the absence of any objection from the parties the Chamber considers that the parties do not request the personal appearance of any of the following witnesses in Court KW KW CP Nic Dunlop KW KW CP Are there any objections that the Chamber has not already heard concerning these witnesses The Chamber hereby removes these witnesses from the witness list The Chamber notes that civil party group has withdrawn its request to hear witnesses CP and CP The Chamber decides not to call these witnesses The Chamber rejects the request of civil party group to hear witnesses KW KW KW CP CP and CP civil party group to hear witnesses KW KW KW KW and KW Reasons The Chamber has considered the list of witnesses and finds that a number would give similar testimony on relevant facts The Chamber has therefore selected a group of witnesses who are likely to give the;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
most relevant testimony in person The parties should bear in mind that all statements made before Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the ECCC during the investigative phase will be put before the Chamber at the relevant time The Chamber therefore removes witnesses KW KW KW KW KW KW CP and CP from the list of those who are to be heard in Court The Chamber wishes to inform the parties that after further consideration it has decided to keep witness KW on the list because the witness can testify to relevant facts concerning Prey Sar   The Trial Chamber considers it unnecessary to retain a reserve list of witnesses who might be called to give evidence orally On Thursday th of June the Chamber informed the parties that it wished to remove an additional witness from the list namely KW and informed the parties that they would have an opportunity to comment on this proposal today Are there any comments on the proposal to remove KW from the witness list Judge Silvia Cartwright you take the floor JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Yes thank you Mr President The President has asked me to state clearly that if there are to be any comments concerning KW that absolutely no identifying details be made concerning this person By that we mean no identifying details as to occupation sex and address nor any details about his occupation at;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the time that we are considering Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page So if there are any comments could you please bear this in mind Thank you Of course this is because this is a public discussion about this particular potential witness Thank you MR PETIT Good morning Mr President Thank you Madam Judge   We have indeed brief comments about this particular witness I would either suggest however that the substance of these comments would be lacking if we cannot address specifics of his expected testimony Therefore I would suggest perhaps for the sake of efficiency either go in camera  which might not be the best  so that we can get on with the witnesses or perhaps written comments by the close of business day tomorrow could be forwarded to the Chamber and then we can proceed with the days business Deliberation between Judges MR PRESIDENT Thank you Mr CoProsecutor for your observation Since this needs to be discussed in closed camera  or in closed session then we will give opportunity for you to make your observation concerning this KW before we can make the final decision So the Chamber would like to give opportunity to you to file the written submission by tomorrow p m Is there any other party who would wish to make any observation Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page concerning KW since our last notice to the parties on Thursday afternoon The defence counsel would you like to make any comments concerning this proposal   MR KAR SAVUTH Thank you Mr President Regarding the proposal to remove KW from the witness list we do not have any objection because there have been several witnesses already and since these two witnesses would only testify on the same fact and since one is already selected I think it is significant to have one witness MR PRESIDENT Thank you Mr Lawyer In addition the Chamber wishes to inform the parties of the following technical details The Chamber will hear KW for one and a half days David Chandler for one day KW for a halfday CP for a halfday KW and Françoise SironiGuilbard jointly for one day and a half The Chamber will hear Françoise SironiGuilbard in person It will hear Richard J Goldstone and Stephane Hessel through videoconference The Chamber does not accept the suggestion of the defence to provide it and the CoProsecutors with the opportunity to be next to witnesses testifying by videoconference The Chamber takes this opportunity to inform the parties that Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Charles Figley has declined the invitation to testify and the Chamber does not plan to compel him to appear So this is;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the decision regarding  or the subsequent decisions from the trial management meeting conducted on the afternoon of Thursday Except witness KW since the written submission is pending from the CoProsecutor the Trial Chamber will make a decision on this matter after we have received his written submission first There are still remaining issues concerning the legal aspects and in order to clarify this for example the matter of the joint criminal enterprise I would like to give the floor to Judge Lavergne to make his observations concerning the matter The floor is yours JUDGE LAVERGNE Thank you Mr President On this last point the Chamber has taken note of conclusions submitted by the CoProsecutors on the th of June whereby the Chamber is requested to on the hand state that the legal concept of joint criminal enterprise in its three forms is applicable before the Extraordinary Chambers and on the other hand to apply this notion in its judgment as regards the commission of crimes charged against the accused as well as his responsibility as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise   The Trial Chamber recalls that the CoProsecutors have indicated their intention to rely on the notion of joint criminal Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page enterprise during the initial hearing Consequently the Trial Chamber considers that the issue of the mode of responsibility of the accused including as a;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
participant in a JCE is currently before it and invites the parties to make submissions on the filing by the CoProsecutors in accordance with the practice directives and in particular following notification in the languages which they require Finally the Trial Chamber clarifies that at this stage it considers rendering its decision on this matter at the same time as the judgement on merits MR PRESIDENT So next the decision to hear the testimony of the survivors of S Court officials could you please bring the witness Vann Nath into the courtroom Witness enters courtroom   QUESTIONING BY THE BENCH BY MR PRESIDENT Q Is your name Vann Nath A Yes Q Do you have another name besides Nath A No I do not have one Q How old are you this year A I am years old Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q Where is your current residence A I live in Mittapheap  Sangkat Mittapheap Prampi Makara district Phnom Penh Q What is your occupation A I am a painter Q Are you still practising your profession as a painter A Due to my poor health I do not work much as a painter Q Have you taken an oath yet A Yes I have   Q Are you related by blood or by law to any people in this case A No Q Today the Chamber invites you;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
to provide your testimony regarding the S office which is now known as Tuol Sleng prison and in the proceedings the Chamber would like to inform you your rights and obligations as a witness as follows As you are summonsed by the Trial Chamber as a witness in this proceeding you have the obligation to testify to the facts that you have seen have heard and secondly as a witness you have the right to refuse to answer if you think its going to incriminate yourself Do you understand what I have said regarding your rights and obligations A Yes I do Q Can you recall before the th April where did you live Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page and what was your profession A Mr President from what I can recall in I lived in the Battambang provincial town I was a painter at the time   Q And until the April where did  now on the April which was the main date where were you and what did you do A On the th I was still in the Battambang provincial town Q In the provincial town of Battambang did the Khmer soldiers enter and occupy on that date or when A From what I can recall that was the day  that is the April  at or p m  at noon we received a lot of;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
information in the provincial town that the liberation soldiers reached the Veal Bek Chan which was about one kilometre from the town and that they surrounded the area and that the war would be over very soon So we were all aware of that information in Battambang Q And after the April where did you go and what did you do A After the liberation soldiers took control of Battambang for two days they had a plan to evacuate all the people from the province I and my family were evacuated to the northwest of town about eight kilometres It was the rice field and there were no people at the time   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page At that location we had to find accommodation for ourselves and we had to work in the rice fields all of us Q What village was that The rice fields where you lived and worked A It was in O Mony Pir village District in sector That was the names before the liberation soldiers entered It was also known as Norea Commune Sanke subdistrict Q On what day did you leave the Battambang provincial town A I left Battambang on the day that we were all evacuated and five days later we  five or six days later we arrived in that location because the walking was slow and the situation was rather chaotic;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
So from my estimation it took us five six or seven days Q What were you asked to do when you were at O Mony Pir in District A First we had to find a shelter for ourselves There was no houses there were only trees and rice fields so we went through the brush to find the trees and the palm leaves to make our temporary accommodation And in the afternoon we were called for a meeting to divide into various groups for working in the rice fields on the next day Q So first after you made your own shelter they had you work in the rice field Is this correct A Yes Q How long did you stay there Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   A From my recollection I stay there from the day that I arrived until the th of December when Angkar arrested me Q So you were arrested by Angkar at O Mony Pir in sector right A At that time I was called from that location and I was arrested in Balatt Cooperative Its near the Songke River which was about five kilometres from the cooperative where I lived Q Can you describe to the Chamber the events concerning Angkar from the day of your arrest until you were transferred from Battambang to Phnom Pehn that is to S office So it means the;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
details from the day you were arrested until you were transferred to S Can you describe all the events within that period A Mr President I will describe based on my recollection of the events from my arrest On the th of December  by the time that I was working in the rice field It was harvesting season which was north  it was about five or six kilometres from the cooperative where I lived At about five p m the chief of the Cooperative Luom who was in charge of economics for sector went to the worksite and he told me Angkar instructed him to go to Pursat and he collected some forces already However he still needed some forces and he pointed to me whether I could go with him Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   When he pointed directly to me at that time I was about to get my food ration I was worried because Pursat was a far distance from Battambang but I did not object to him and I told him Its up to you brother if that was the Angkars instruction then I have to go So you have to pack he told me but because we were in the rice field I did not have my possessions just a few sets of old clothes So I was on his oxcart with him and;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
when we arrived at the cooperative it was nearly dusk already and I asked him to go to my house quickly and he allowed me to go but he said you had to return soon So I went into my house and I told my wife that I was instructed to go to the province I did not say much so I left my house and when we arrived at big cooperative and this Comrade Luom was standing there waiting for me So then we rode on an oxcart There was only himself myself and a militia man I was not aware that I would be arrested When we arrived at the Balatt Cooperative he told me to go and rest and after I rested for about half an hour I was woken up and I was instructed to go and bring the oxcart another oxcart I asked him how could we bring another oxcart because we do not have extra cows He said dont worry just go and pick up an oxcart Only two steps after I walked I was arrested Those were the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page militia whom I recognized They were from my village since I was young and that one militia man from what I know had killed a lot of people So I resisted the arrest but Comrade Thean the chief of the cooperative instructed the;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
militia to tie me and I asked him What did I do wrong  He said he did not know but there was an instruction to arrest myself So in the cooperative there was a prison and I was sent there It was a rice barn and they shackled my legs the same type of shackles used at S I was not know all the times but quite a while later they took me out and they walked me and we rode on the oxcart for  it was about midnight and I was placed at the Samrong Pagoda The Samrong Pagoda was a very popular detention site in sector So they detained me there together with another cousin of mine Say Sarak so we stayed there overnight and we were not interrogated In the morning on the next day at about a m I heard the sound of a motorbike a Honda motorbike so the prison was in fact a Bible hall as part of the pagoda They opened the door and they called my name Heng Nath that was my name at the time Heng actually was the name of my godfather so I used the surname Heng Nath Actually my father was Vann Sam but after he had me as his godson I used his name as my surname Heng Nath   So that was what I know during the Khmer Rouge regime After my name was called I raised my hand and they took me;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
out and a Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page prison guard told me to go out and to resolve the matters and I asked where And the guard said No need to talk You will know when you go and meet them and you have to resolve the matters with them And if they decide to let you go then you could go back home  So I was placed on the Honda motorbike with Sarak and there was a rider and a militiaman with the AK rifle behind us but we were not cuffed So we rode and we left the pagoda to the Kandal Pagoda along the Songke River I did not know that Kandal Pagoda was also a prison After we arrived there were four or five soldiers in black They arrested us immediately and sent us inside Sarak went to one direction and I went to another direction In that room I saw another person who was shackled with a wooden shackle and later on I realized there were other people there were five of us So the wooden shackle was thick Its about centimetres thick and the height was rather high They drilled a hole and our feet were put into the holes and they used a clamp to tighten the wooden shackle At about p m I was taken off the shackle for interrogation so they tied my;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
hands to the back and they put another shackle and I thought probably that was the end of my life So they walked me to the back of the pagoda and I was interrogated as it was alleged that I was a traitor for Angkar and the revolution and they wanted to find the treacherous network of soldiers Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   They asked me for things that I never knew For instance how many times were the meetings held and where and who participated in the meetings and what are their names and where are they now I myself I never attended any meeting with anybody I did not have time In the morning when the bell was rung we had to go and work and sometimes we rested for a bit and we went to work again The meetings were only those meetings held at the cooperative Then a person said You have to try to remember because Angkar never made any wrong arrest How could I think if I never attended such event So then they used an electrical wire There was a table four or five metres away from me and they dragged a cable from that table to the location where I sat on a chair but when I went into that interrogation room I was already shocked There were red plastic bags hanging on;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the wall there were screws there were metal screws and clubs and the chair where I sat there were blood drains blood spots everywhere So then the person asked me again whether I remembered and as I could not say anything they used the electrical wire attached to a pin and attached to my pants and my flesh on my foot and another one was attached to the back of the cuff and then they turned on the electricity After that I became unconscious I became conscious again after they splashed the water on my face and then they kept asking me again on the traitors on the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page treacherous network Those events I did not know   I became unconscious several times then they brought me back to the room I was not sure what I answered to them because my mind was not clear at the time I thought if they did that to me again tomorrow then I would be dead because in my mind after they took me back to the room and if there was a big jar of water I would drink it all because I felt so hot But next day another person was taken out for the interrogation so they did not interrogate me again until the th January when a few guards holding some documents calling the names of;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the prisoners from the rooms including my name So we were unshackled from the room and we were lined up outside and we were cuffed There were two trucks waiting for us so we were instructed to board the trucks So I thought that would be the end already because when we boarded the truck probably they would take us to where they would kill us So I boarded the truck and then they shackled us again with a wooden shackle There were six of us in that long row and there were people altogether in that truck and on another truck there were people So in the afternoon the trucks left I became hopeless already every one of us because we knew that we would be killed But the trip was so long and when the night fell we did not have even have anything to eat or were given anything to eat Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page At about midnight the trucks stopped but we were not sure where we were At that time I did not know where the trucks stopped only later on that I knew It was in front of the current Beehive radio station So the trucks stopped there and with our feet shackled they did not allow us to disembark the trucks yet So then they used cuffs to cuff one hand of each prisoner to;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
another hand of another prisoner Then they took off the shackles but we were so weak and tired already noone could not walk So we were unstable we could not stand so they instructed us to sit in two lines and we were asked about biography where we came from what is our name so I told them my name that I came from the fifth cooperative from the Northwest Zone After I answered the biography questions all of us were blindfolded and they used the hammock rope to tie our necks in line and walked us with that rope At that time we could not see it was dark so first of all we only listened and followed the footsteps Sometimes we didnt know that we had to turn so some of us stumbled and hit the zinc fence and they laughed at us And they said they joked around that we were like the blind and sometimes they kicked us and I was kicked as well I did not know what wrong I made or I did So I fell and I got up and continued walking   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page And after we arrived into a room we were each photographed After they took off the blindfold I saw the camera in front of my face already So then one prisoner would be photographed while the next;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
would sit because we were cuffed together and we take turns to be photographed And I think it was  I was then placed in the second floor which is now marked Building D and we were put into the long row of shackles There were or of us in each row of those shackles And the black clothes that we were wearing we were stripped of those clothes Some had shorts and they just wore the shorts For those who did not have any shorts they were given shorts about an hour later They were only like shorts with nothing to tighten the waist because probably they were afraid that maybe we would take the string from the waist tightening to hang ourselves to commit suicide The conditions were so inhumane and the food was so little There was a big pot of gruel to be distributed among or of us so we only had three spoons of gruel for each meal and the spoon was like a coffee spoon  so little Its not like a normal rice spoon And the spoons would be collected and if any prisoner hid or concealed a spoon and if they found it out then they would beat up or kick So the living conditions and the food during the two or three days was so inhumane I lost my dignity because the condition of the prisoners and the guards were so distant Its like humans Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009

we were allowed to do exercise our legs were still shackled to the metal bars and we could like hop to do exercise If we didnt hop then they would beat us also We were so weak and how could we hop But we just did it Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page against our will to avoid being whipped And while doing the exercise we could only stop hopping after we received an order or permission from the guards Otherwise we would hop until we died   And they allowed us to have a bath and a young guard would use a hose a water hose and pour the water on approximately prisoners all at once and after five minutes they would stop pouring the water So we had never been washed or had a bath for quite some time so we had developed some kind of skin rashes and we felt so itchy and the floor was wet and we couldnt sleep after the bath So we had to remove our clothes to dry the wet floor until it dried so that we could sit up Of course we had to remove our clothes to do so but it was so uncomfortable because we were shackled and then we had to remove our clothes while still being shackled You could imagine how difficult it was And we were so hungry that;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
we could eat insects even the insects that dropped from the ceiling Then we would immediately grab it and eat and when we were eating such insects and spotted by the guards then we would lie to them that we did not do anything If they found out that we were eating insects we would be beaten also so we could do that only if we avoid being seen by the guards So the death is imminent and people died one after another and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page at about to p m the corpse would be removed and we ate our meal next to the dead body and we did not care anyway because we were like animals and everyone would be treated the same And until the day we were  I was taken downstairs I could hardly walk because after more than one month being motionless I was so skinny and weak And then after hearing that I would be called I started to realize that my day had come because people came to ask in my room to see whether there was the brother named Nath which was my name Then I was so frightened to hear that people would be looking or searching for my name and then I told myself that I didnt care any longer because I could be killed any time if they would;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
wish to do so and I better died rather than living in such condition And I did not think of any other thing other than being thirsty and hungry I was so hungry that I had never experienced that hunger before and I thought that even eating a human flesh would be a good meal for me also at that moment   And then when they searched for my name and called my name then they asked people to remove my cuff and I was the last person in a line of other prisoners so they had to remove other prisoners before they could really remove me from the cuffs And as I told you after I was removed from the cuffs I could not stand up I needed assistance to make sure I could stand up and because I Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page could not move any inches during the last more than one month under detention And that day I came downstairs and I was not blindfolded although my handcuffs were still on and I noticed earlier that when prisoners were taken to be interrogated or taken away then they would be blindfolded but I observed that I was removed my blindfold because I believed that they did so not to  I mean when people were blindfolded because they didnt want people to recognize anything so I felt;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
a little bit different when I was not blindfolded Then I was walked by three people Two helped me to walk from upstairs downward and then we went into the middle building  the room  and then I saw a few people sitting there At the beginning I did not know who they were but later on I knew they were the chiefs in that location I didnt know his name because people called him Brother East and I just called him Brother East and then he asked me how long I had been in painting And then I told him about my background of my painting experience in so its almost five  sorry years Then I saw the other people who were already there I remember Bou Meng and another person from France Sunkhun and the other three people before me And he said that the Angkar needed a big portrait of the leaders and they asked us whether we could produce or paint such a picture   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page And I told him that I had not been practicing this painting for long but I would do my best to paint the portrait And then he gave me a big photo and I did not know who he was because I was in the rural area and I did not know that a person I;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
knew he would have been the leader but he asked me to paint a bigger portrait of this individual And my ears at that time were difficult to listen to him and he asked me to take a rest for three days and he said that I smelled like shit and then asked me to have my moustache and hair shaved and asked that two guards had to accompany me in order to avoid me being committing suicide and I told him that  I assured him not to worry because I was already freed and I enjoyed this moment So they gave me a scarf a Khmer scarf and sets of clothes to change but I had developed skin rashes all over my body I didnt remember when or what date it was but it was about that I was given the rice I could not chew the rice because my jaws became so sore that I could only chew about a few chewings and then I stopped And after a moment then the East Brother advised me to work on the portrait and he asked me to try to paint a draft of a portrait and then I tried And after my detention and for long then I felt so trembling holding the paintbrush and I knew that if I did not paint well I would be in big trouble I was so nervous Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
  ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page The first portrait was bad because it was a black and white portrait because I did not learn that At school I learned how to mix colours in painting but when it comes to black and white it was a new skill for me I told him that I would like to switch to painting the colour portrait   Then he asked  he gave me the choices he said that okay whatever you could be good at then you should choose it and to make sure that Angkar would be pleased And then I realized that it was the life and death situation Of course the colour portrait could save my life If I made the portrait attractive then the Angkar would be pleased with the painting then I would be spared from being executed At the beginning the portrait was not that good but he believed that I was a painter so he could make use of me at the location and I had been working hard on my work and then they picked guards to guard my work until the th of January I hope this is the brief summary of my background and story Q You said you were arrested at Battambang province but you were not told of any offences of yours while being arrested A They did not tell me anything They asked me to collect rattan in Pursat Q Then when you were interrogating;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
then you were asked to produce the networks  the traitorous network and other associates to topple the regime at that time is that correct Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A Thats correct Your Honour   Q When you were sent to Phnom Penh how long would it take to get to Phnom Penh Is it one night or one day and a half A So far as I remember I left at about oclock and I arrived at Phnom Penh at about a m in the morning Q You said that you were not given any food on the road when you were on the way to Phnom Penh So you wanted to relieve yourself were you allowed to do so among the other people A They would not allow us to do so They only threw a container a fivelitre container for us to relieve ourselves in such a container Its an ammunition box Q You said that there were six  there were two truckloads of people So there were people on those two trucks   My question is that when people were shackled to their legs with the wooden form of shackles were their hands also cuffed or handcuffed A Our hands were not handcuffed Q Were you blindfolded when you were being sent from Battambang to Phnom Penh A No we were not blindfolded Your Honour;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Q You already told us about the arrest Angkar made against you and you told us details a brief detail about your captivity until the th of January The Chamber would like you to also Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page tell us more concerning the food ration You said you were detained at Building D and that you were given three spoons of gruel two times a day So how could you manage to eat your meals since you were shackled to the legs and that you could not even sit up or how  could you elaborate about eating habits at that location A Mr President there was a guard who would bring a big bowl of gruel and place it next to the metal bar and then ask us to share the gruel to distribute the gruel among ourselves So we were given the spoons to take the gruel from that big bowl and then the gruel was distributed So we were given a plate and a spoon a teaspoon not a rice spoon And there was a dish of soup a very small dish of soup with banana tree used as vegetable and then we could eat  we could finish in just two or three spoons Since it was the teaspoon and we could feel like it took longer to finish the meal although it was very minimal ;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
 And then we could not move from our location We just left the plate next to us until they were collected by the guard Q So after eating your meals then the guard would collect all the big bowls and plates and spoons Do I understand that correctly A Mr President that is correct Q During the time when you were detained and as you said you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page had to relieve yourself into a container and then you ate there you slept there the question is that how could the waste human waste be discarded A The guards  there was one young guard who would come and collect the waste to be discarded and then would bring us the new containers for us to use it for another day So he would repeat these routines Q You mentioned something which is of good interest that you said that the prisoners were allowed to only wear the underwear while the clothes were stripped off And the belts of the pants or the shorts would be removed to avoid  to ensure that prisoners could not use it to commit suicide So when you mentioned about clothes clothes refer to shirts and trousers So can you tell us whether prisoners would be stripped of their clothes entirely I mean some of them would be naked waiting for the guards;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
to bring clothes to them or all had some clothes to wear on   A When our clothes were stripped off they only removed the black clothes because the black clothes would be taken away Other clothes other than the black ones would be left with us However those clothes would not contain any kind of string or belts and we could not even see any shirts with buttons Q So a prisoner could have a shirt pants and some spare clothes or would they be allowed to have one set of clothes Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page only A Your Honour actually we were allowed to only have only the dress or the clothes that we were wearing not other additional clothes Q You said that after having a bath you got soaked or wet but how could you really take off your pants I mean to dry it  I mean for the shirt it would be okay but how could you really remove your pants from the shackles because you said that your legs were already attached to the shackles So I dont know how you could remove it from the shackles Could you please explain how it worked And I mean how you could dry your clothes before you could put them on please I think we find it difficult to understand and need your further elaboration on;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
this A Mr President I would like to clarify it as follows Our legs  I would like to apologize Actually I would like to put my legs up here The legs were shackled So if we removed our pants then we can remove the pants entirely from one leg but then we insert the remaining of the pants into a you know like the margins of the shackles so when it got soaked then it was soft so it could be removed but it took about minutes to remove it from our body entirely So then we would dry it and then wear it in the way how we actually removed it So it took us so much time Thats how it worked Q We notice that when you were arrested on the th of  you arrived at the place on the th or th of January it was Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page cold during that time Could you please tell us the condition in that room when it was cold and then you got wet Were you given any blanket or any other kind of scarf to cover during the night to make you warm or were you left soaked A Mr President we had no other choice other than being very patient and we had to bear with it whatever it was   Q What about the;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
other prisoners Were they subjected to the same condition or were they exceptional A Mr President everyone would be treated the same Q In your room you shared a common big room How many prisoners were there during the time when you were in captivity for more than one month A Mr President in our room the number of prisoners could vary Sometimes there were people sometimes there were only and sometimes there were of us It depends on how prisoners were being moved from one room to another I think the highest prisoners in that room was more than people Q In general through your observation you noted that when prisoners were removed or were taken away from the room  were taken on a regular basis and how many of them would be taken away each day A When I was in that room I only knew what happened in the room because I could not see outside It was not very frequent that my inmates were removed Sometimes three of us would be removed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page and one only came back Sometimes three were taken away and then all of them would be returned but sometimes they never came back Q You said during the time when you were detained there were dead bodies and normally when people died you said that they would be left on;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the floor until they would be removed from the room My question is how often did you see such dead bodies or such incidents   A Mr President so far as I recollect during the more than one month I was detained there were four people who died in such a manner Q From your description you yourself were not interrogated by the S interrogators Was it correct or you were not interrogated at all during the time of your detention by the S staff A Mr President I was not interrogated at that location Q So it means you were not tortured besides being detained and starved in that room in such an inhumane condition Is that correct It means you were not taken out to be tortured A Mr President no it did not happen to me Q Did you witness any incident of torture being done by the S staff or interrogators or prison guard on any other prisoners If so what did you see and what led you to see such tortures Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A On this matter I would like to tell to the President that when I went to work on the ground floor I experienced some incidents that is the interrogations Let me highlight an incident to you Mr President   What I clearly saw was highlighted in my painting When;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
you see the location of the wooden frames where children used to climb a prisoner  he was an artist but I do not recall his nationality At that time Brother East  let me use the word Brother East because thats the word I used to call him  Brother East brought that person and that he could sculpture Brother number and the sculpture was exact and in a short period of time because the three of us would spend five or six months just to make one sculpture Probably that artist was clever so that he wanted to tried him and through the experience he in fact not know anything about sculpturing He couldnt even mould So when the sculpture was brought in there were four or five guards and they watched him doing the sculpturing So then Brother East saw that he was useless and he left And the guards took him back but he was not taken to his room He was taken to that location that I described and from the view through the window that I could see I could see that view clearly It was not done during the day It was like or p m at night Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page So I draw that painting in order to depict what I saw but the painting was actually like during the day time but;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
when it happened it was during the night time However when the guards saw that we could see it the guards came and shut the windows so that we could no longer see and that was one incident that I saw And I did not see any other incidents except the screaming from the prisoners We heard screaming almost on a daily basis sometimes from this building or that building   Q And you yourself when you were allowed to paint how were the living conditions Where did you live or stay because you were a prisoner but with a special condition that you were released in order to do the painting So where did you live and what was the food like A There were two stages Mr President First after I went to the ground floor at nighttime a guard took me to a separate room It was not into the same room it was a separate room There were other workshop people who stayed there like woodcrafters and we were not shackled in that room and there was a sleeping mat There was a mosquito net although we could not use it as a mosquito net but we could use it to cover our bodies And later on Angkar seemed to trust me more then I was allowed to stay at the workshop and the food ration was brought in by the guard from outside It was proper There was rice and soup as Extraordinary Chambers;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the food ration for the guards   Q Was it for all for those people who worked in the workshop like Bou Meng A Yes the same Q What did they order you and your group to paint and how many paintings did you do A I could not recall on the number of paintings however from my vague recollection we only painted the pictures of the Party that is the picture of Brother number I could not recall maybe five or six portraits of Brother number And another painting the beating of the Vietnamese in front of the microphone I painted that painting as well And besides I had to do the touchup on the sculptures on the moulds so the three of us  Ieng Chan Mok Sonkhun and myself  the four of us actually  we made the mould for making sculpture of Brother number This is my response Your Honour Q You said Brother East Do you mean the accused whose real name is Kaing Guek Eav alias Duch Is this correct A Mr President yes I meant the accused Q During the time they had an interest in you and ordered you to do the paintings of the leaders of that regime did you observe that Brother East or the accused come often to the place where you do the painting in the;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
workshop If so how many times Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   A My apology Mr President Could you repeat your question Q In the workshop how many times did you see Brother East come to inspect your work If so how many times from what you can recall A Mr President I thought he came almost every day He came very often It was rare that he did not come Q What did you observe regarding his attitude Hes a laughing person a serious person or he was a very worried person A Mr President every time he entered the workshop when we knew that he entered the workshop we had to move to another site in order to wait for his instructions And the second point its typical that we the prisoners had to be afraid of him and to respect him as the top leader as the Angkar in that location And his character from what I could observe he was one of the leaders who was clever vigilant and so his main power and that we were afraid and had to respect him So every time he entered I did not dare to sit in the chair I had to stand up and waited for his instructions   MR PRESIDENT Now it is time to have a break and its also time for changing the DVD recording;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
so the Chamber will adjourn for minutes and resume at a m Court official can you provide refreshment to the witness and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page bring him back when the Court resumes Judges exit courtroom Court recesses from H to H Judges enter courtroom   MR PRESIDENT Please be seated The Court is now back in session BY MR PRESIDENT Q Uncle Nath you did not yet respond to my question that you said you saw the accused visiting the place where you worked very often and how could you describe his facial impression whether he was happy sad or he was full of worries whenever he went to that location So what can you tell us about this A Mr President normally when he came into the workshop he was complimenting or he was appreciating our work for example the good job we done And sometimes when we were behind the schedule then he was not very happy   Q You mentioned about a portrait you painted about a torturing scene in which you could see through a window from the place where you were working It was at night And you said that in order to visualize the incident you only brought it to a portrait of the daylight and you said that you mentioned about a person who could mould a sculpture of Pol Pot and;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
that he said he could make it faster but then he could not do And then the accused Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page was present at that time So when the person who said that he would be the good sculptor failed to keep his promise that he would be a good sculptor so what happened to him Had you heard anything from the accused whether he told something to that person or reprimand him or else A So far as I recall when the person could not do his work then he asked the guard to take him back and then he left And I dont know for sure what happened to that person and I did not hear any orders toward that particular individual but so far as I noticed the guards had the rights to do such things very often during the time when I worked as the painter because the guards could do something spontaneously and made such a decision very often spontaneously Q You said that the guards could do some things spontaneously What kind of activities in which the guards themselves could make such a decision spontaneously that you have observed   A Mr President the East Brother who came to visit the place where I worked he  I think there was a kind of threatening He said that if he could not work properly;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
then he would be in the hands of the guards So I could presume that the guards have exercised the full rights to make their own decision without any further consultation Q In your statement before the CoInvestigating Judges there was Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page an annex attached and there were sketches drawn by you yourself Are all those sketches or the drawings yours A Yes they are mine Q So that drawings reflect the activities of the officials of the Angkar who treated you personally or what A The drawings I would like to classify them into three parts First I saw it with my own eyes Number two I only heard but I never saw it but I could imagine how the situation  how it happened And number three I heard from prisoners who shared the room So this is how the drawings could be produced MR PRESIDENT The AV unit could you please attach the drawings with ERN from to And D Could you please make sure that they are projected on the monitors   Could you please start from the first drawing ERN first The AV unit what happened Could you please advise us whether it is possible to have it projected on the monitors The CoProsecutors could you please be of any assistance to project that picture MR PETIT Mr President with pleasure BY MR;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009

 ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page BY MR PRESIDENT Q What about this picture A This picture is about a prisoner who was detained in an individual cell under Building C A B and D because when I was first sent in under those buildings there were individual cells But later on only Building A could have the individual cells The other cells were removed So after any prisoner was interrogated then the hope was very slim that they could survive or live Thats why they were detained into an individual cell and being desperate and hopeless Q So you only drew this picture or painted this picture based on your recollection of other people having told you or based on your experience A I used to see these cells because during the time when I worked there I would pass some of the cells   MR PRESIDENT Could you please move to the next photo BY MR PRESIDENT Q Can you tell us anything about this picture What is it about A Mr President I did not see this incident I only heard from what happened in Building B because normally the guards  a few guards would take children from their parents and I could hear the scream of those parents and the parents who would probably Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page have tried to take back their children;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
from the guards So it was based on my imagination and what I heard MR PRESIDENT The next picture please BY MR PRESIDENT Q Does this picture show anything could you please tell us A Mr President this photo  this painting  was drawn based on the information I was told by a prisoner who was interrogated by waterboarding technique that he was suffocating MR PRESIDENT Could you please show the fifth picture please BY MR PRESIDENT Q What about this picture could you please tell us about it   A This picture was drawn from the recollection of what the prisoner told me Mr Pa Tha Chan the Vietnamese translator during interrogation when Vietnamese were interrogated he told me about this And I think Brother East knew that because he was placed  immersed into a basin filled with water and he drank too much of the water and then later on the guard would step on his stomach to make him vomit all those water And in the German people  East German people who came to file the document for S and he gestured in that movie  the documentary about being immersed into that improvised basin and thats why I could draw such a painting based on his request of Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page his recollection of the torture Q Has he survived S A He;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009

ask her in detail And she said she was interrogated and that her female character was lost And with the scorpion  with the poisonous insect were based on descriptions of the guards There was an old guard He was feeding those insect and when I asked him what he did he told me that he was asked to feed those insects And sometime he fed those insects with ants and sometimes they would come and take those insects or the centipede and when I asked the female prisoner she said she was interrogated and she was bitten with that centipede   Q Thank you MR PRESIDENT Please move onto the next painting BY MR PRESIDENT Q What does the painting reflect the types of torture A Mr President a victim but he already passed away His name was Oeng Bech He was the  he used to be the chairman of the Genocide Museum of Tuol Sleng He told me that his nails were pulled in that way So he lost some of the fingernails as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page result of this types of torture so I painted this image for him as a souvenir So this one reflects the actual torture done by the S staff on Oeng Bech Q After you did the painting was Oeng Bech still alive to  and whether he receive it;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
and he reflected that it was the actual torture reflection on him A Mr President from what I can recall the S museum was opened in and he died in so he had that picture for more than years Q Thank you MR PRESIDENT Please move onto the next painting that is painting number nine   BY MR PRESIDENT Q Can you describe this painting A This painting was a reflection of Bou Meng It was his idea that he describes the way he was tortured that they took turns to beat him up So I made that painting for Bou Meng Q Thank you MR PRESIDENT Please move to painting number BY MR PRESIDENT Q What about this painting can you describe the painting what does it reflect A Mr President it is unclear I only made this painting to Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page reflect what happened at Choeung Ek from the hearsay but I dont think it was the way it was done but because the  or the unclear information And actually only one hand was tied and after the person was dead then the throat was slashed so this painting does not reflect the reality So it was less cruel than what happened at Choeung Ek At Choeung Ek the tied was not done in that way After the person was clubbed and died then the throat;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
was slashed Thats what I learnt later by a person who used to be a former person in the special force group MR PRESIDENT Thank you Please move on to painting number BY MR PRESIDENT Q So you already described this painting the reflection of torture on a person who boasted to be a good artist but it turned out that he was not a real artist Then the accused ordered him to be returned and then the guards tortured him that way and you saw this view during the night But in order to make it easier on the eyes in the painting you painted it as it happened during the day Is this the picture that you referred to   A That is correct Mr President MR PRESIDENT Please move on to painting number Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page BY MR PRESIDENT Q And what about this painting what does it reflect A I saw two people carrying a very skinny person whose hands and feet were tied into a wooden pole Mr President I saw this incident personally When the prisoners were moved out during that time I thought they would be moved out and to be integrated into the cooperatives for rice production for instance Thats what I thought This person could not walk He didnt eat and he was so sick for quite some time and he;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
could not walk by himself so that was the way that he was carried by young guards about to years old And when I turned my head and I saw this incident and I was rather moved and shocked by what I saw I thought the person already died but actually he was still speaking and his eyes were blindfolded so it means he was not yet dead So he was taken out to be put into the truck which was waiting outside   MR PRESIDENT Please move on to the last painting number BY MR PRESIDENT Q And this painting drawn by you what does it reflect and what is the likely location of your reflection in this painting A Mr President after I heard about Choeung Ek as a burial mass grave site we went there and we saw a lot of mass graves so we knew about the umbrella branches of S at Choeung Ek where Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page people were killed Q Thank you You left the Security Office S and when was that A Mr President I left the S compound on the January at noon Q How many went along with you and where did you go A Mr President on that day after I heard the gun explosions on the main street we were gathered into the painting workshop There were woodcrafters and;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
some other artists totalling more than There were about or of us in the workshop At about halfanhour later that was noon there were four or five armed guards came and ordered us to leave the room to walk in one line to follow them And they threatened us to walk in one straight line If we stayed one  if we even made one step out of the line we would be shot dead We were so scared And I saw that was the time   So we walked I did not even dare to pick up my scarf it was nearby I only had the clothes on me So we followed them walking across the Tuol Tumpoung market That was so quiet at the time So we walked past that area down to Boeng Tumpoung area and towards Chamkardon and we arrived at Prey Sar almost at dusk And when we arrived there we saw a lot of people who were already there and we walked throughout the night So because of Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the chaotic situation some of us separated and we reunited in the early morning and then I walked and I almost reached Ang Snuol The four or five prison guards were already waiting for us there so we did not have anything to eat for one day already on the of January And;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
on the of January when we arrived at that location the soldiers asked us to eat the watermelons and after that we had to cross National Road Number and then we would be out of harms way So at a m in the morning we crossed the National Road Number in a number of lines There were some lines to the left and to the right of my line and almost  we almost reached the National Road Number Its about metres away We saw some trucks with the Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers on the trucks with a flag displaying on the truck The lines on the right of my line fired at those trucks and then they responded and then there was an exchange of fire and those forces who guarded us fled in separate directions So we all were separated Ieng Chan Oeng Bech and Ta Kong and I were the only four in one group so we waited for those who would arrive later on For example we expected that maybe there would be guards or other prisoners who would arrive so we would wait for them and we dared not to go anywhere because we were afraid that the Vietnamese soldiers would shoot us and kill us   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page And because we were so hungry we did not have anything to eat so we;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
were waiting nearby the main road So when we made a decision whether to follow them or not and I was afraid that I would be dead if I had to follow them because we did not have anything to eat and I wanted to go back to Phnom Penh but then I was told if I go back to Phnom Penh then my throat would be slashed by Vietnamese soldiers I myself I was determined to go back to Phnom Penh and the two or three of them then followed me And then we saw some trucks driving by and they waved to us not to go to that direction And on the th of January at p m I felt a bit liberal and when we arrived in Phnom Penh it was the th of January and there were some Cambodian soldiers waiting to receive us They were friendly They gave us rice and food amongst with other people And there were only four of us in the group About one year later after the museum was established then we saw three others Bou Meng Pha Tha Chan and Chum Mey So initially only four of us who arrived This is my response Mr President   Q Thank you And another view that the Chamber wants to know is that during the th of January  on that day when the liberation army arrived the armies of the National United Front with the support of the Vietnamese;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
soldiers to come and liberate Phnom Penh and when you left that you were ordered to walk in Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page one line The question is for the remaining prisoners how many of them altogether And when you were asked to go along with them besides the guns pointing at you were you cuffed or were a string used to tie all of you up A Mr President from what I can recall at that time we left the painting workshop there were woodcrafters electricians blacksmiths and there were about of us We were ordered to leave but we were not tied or handcuffed We walked with our bare hands but we were ordered to walk only in one straight line And there were no other prisoners remained in the prison Probably only a few left after the October or November the prisons were quiet since that time There was a special prison at Building A There were some when I left When I left there were some of them there I saw their heads from what we saw from the distance but we didnt know when they died Q The remaining prisoners who were later on buried there how many of them did you see at the Tuol Sleng museum A I saw burial locations or tombs here at the Tuol Sleng museum so I presume there were of them;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
left and later on the chairman Oeng Bech made a concrete tomb for those people who died   Q Regarding your personal matter when Khmer Rouge Angkar arrested you and sent you from Battambang to Phnom Penh to be Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page detained at S Detention Centre what happened to your family your wife and children because you have not yet mentioned about your family A Mr President on the day I was arrested I only was arrested alone and my wife and children were at the cooperative number I had two children staying with my wife The eldest was five and the youngest was six months old After I was freed and after I returned I learned that my children died Only my wife survived and she is with me at the present time Q Thank you for your information in this testimony to depict the incidents and the events that you went through during the Democratic Kampuchea from the April to the th of January MR PRESIDENT Next I would like to inquire if any Judges of the Bench have any questions to ask this survivor who is now as a witness related to the fact of S Judge Lavergne you take the floor BY JUDGE LAVERGNE Q Could you explain to us the difficulties that you encountered after your release after you left S and the traumatic;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
experience that you went through and how you were able to eventually overcome this A Mr President Your Honour the oneyear period of my detention at S was the period that I tried my best emotionally Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page and physically to accomplish the tasks ordered by Angkar I tried to use all the skills I had to accomplish those tasks for the only purpose that is survival So my suffering and my separation that happened to me during the oneyear period and during the three years eight months period of the regime as a whole cannot be erased easily from my memory Even I tried my best to forget and try not to remember it still haunts me It still makes me to remember what happened So in summary it cannot be forgotten I dont think I can never ever forget what happened to me Your Honour Q We have seen that you made many paintings and if I understood correctly you returned not too long after you left S back to where S was set up to paint paintings Your also partook in documentary films and I believe you also wrote a book Can you tell us why it is so important for you to testify in this way A Your Honour Mr President this is what I have thought since I was detained at S I determined if;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
one day I survived and had freedom and that I could leave that location I would compile the events to reflect on what happened so that the younger generation knew  would know of our suffering and that the of us who were transferred over to S never committed anything wrong Therefore those who came along with me to S the majority of them did not know anything or any offence that would lead to their arrest They were perplexed as to what happened why they Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page were arrested So I had to reveal I had to write I had to compile and it can be served as a mirror to reflect to the younger generation of the lives of those who were accused with no reason who committed no wrong and that they were punished that way That was the very suffering that we received and the suffering that we had because we told them the truth and they did not believe it There was nothing else more than that Thats why I determined I attempted and I tried to explain to the younger children through various programs through them so that the younger generation would understand the experience so that they would consider and that they would try to avoid the repeat of such historical events   Q You came today to testify Are you expecting;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
anything in particular from this trial Would you  are you wishing for something special in this trial A Your Honour I have thought from the beginning  that was after I never imagined that I would be able to sit in this courtroom today to describe about my plight of the experience to the younger generations to the general public to understand what happened to me and now I have the ability to testify before this Chamber in public This is my privilege This is my honour I do not want anything more than that What I want is something that is intangible that is justice for Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page those that already died Whatever way the justice could be done is my only hope that can be achieved by this Chamber And I hope by the end of the Tribunal that justice can be tangible can be seen by everybody and that it is something that I expect as a result as an outcome of this Chamber of this Tribunal and this is what I wanted Your Honour Q I would like to revisit an incident that was a bit specific that you mentioned involving another painter who was working with you in the workshop at Tuol Sleng an incident between this painter and Duch You were relating an incident involving Bou Meng Do you remember what happened between;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Bou Meng and Duch A Your Honour Bou Meng was tortured for his mistakes but I dont know what kind of mistakes he had But at that time at about p m we were about to break from work Then there was a guard Mr Peng a rather higher or senior staff And then he was watching us at the place for some time and I was scared but I did not ask him any questions I just continued working And then later on he said Contemptible Meng get out   And then Meng wore his shirt on and then he left Then I asked him that Now the guard asked you to go out and when you come back dont forget the cigarette to bring the cigarette for me also  Then when he left I never saw him again for long I was waiting to see him back but it was in vain I thought that probably he would be released and integrated into Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the cooperative but after about two weeks I took a rest  I mean after work  and I was about to fall asleep Then I heard someone calling from downstairs and asked me to send back the painter  the guard to send the painter And I thought what would happen then Then I came downstairs and I was working;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
was back to work There were four people Comrade Chan Sunkhun I myself and another person and we did not know what would happen A little while later we heard the sounds of the chains which were being dragged along the corridor and then at the door we saw Meng who was chained to his neck and legs He was pale and his hair grew longer and my heart beat so quickly at that moment And Brother East was there at that moment and then Meng was called in and he said Contemptible Meng what have you promised to me  And then Bou Meng said I did not know anything  and then he sat right in front of me kneeled down and apologized to every one of us   And actually I did not know anything about what happened to him when he was taken away And then he was taken back and later on he said that whether contemptible Meng could be used any longer or could he be used to make fertilizer And I thought that fertilizer here means the fertilizer for plants or crops at the cooperative And then  and I thought that since he was also an artist and when he was made to work to make fertilizer it would not be a proper job for him so thats why I talked to him that Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
TC KAING GUEK EAV Page please forgive him for his wrongdoing and give him an opportunity to stay here and if he made further mistakes then he would be decided I think he probably did not listen to me but since Meng could be a good painter then he would be longer used at that location and his leg was shackled chained and then he asked me to watch him and that he must not move any inches from that location and that was the last time that he could correct himself so he would  he was back to work So this is what I could recall about that person your Honour MR PRESIDENT It is now time for lunch so the Chamber would like to take an adjournment until pm Judges exit courtroom Court recesses from H to H  Judges enter courtroom   MR PRESIDENT Please be seated The Chamber is now back in session We will continue to hear the testimony of a witness who is also a survivor from S Vann Nath I would like now to give the floor to the Judges of the Bench if you have questions to be put to this witness Judge Ya Sokhan the floor is yours JUDGE YA SOKHAN Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Thank you Mr President BY JUDGE YA SOKHAN Q Uncle Nath can you confirm when you;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
were first detained in the rice barn Was it a prison to detain people in that subdistrict or was it a temporary detention A Your Honour I was first detained in the rice barn It was the cooperative detention The cooperative name was Cooperative Q So it was for the Angkar district detention centre A No It was not It was the cooperative prison When people were first detained they would be detained there temporarily Two or three hours later they would be sent to the subdistrict and District That was at the Samrong Pagoda Q So they were sent to be detained at the Samrong Pagoda What was the prison like in that pagoda A Your Honour the prison at Samrong Pagoda belongs to District of Sector It was for the entire pagoda It was converted into a prison and after the liberation of it was noted that a lot of people died and there was a memorial site it was quite a big one built there for those lost souls   Q So it was at Samrong Pagoda What about the detention centre at the Kandal Pagoda A Your Honour the detention at the Kandal Pagoda from what I understood it belongs to the Northwest Zone Because people Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page were sent there from various other prisons for example from Moung Ruessei District Banan District they were;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
all sent to that big prison Q When you were detained at the Samrong Pagoda were you given food on that day A Your Honour on that day we were given a meal around or a m in the morning It was a small bowl of gruel and with a few salts pieces of salt Q When you rested during the night were your handcuffs taken off A On the first night that I was detained at the Samrong Pagoda my legs were shackled but I was not handcuffed Q Did they interrogate you at the time A No I was not interrogated I only stayed there for a short period of time Q When you were sent to Kandal Pagoda how many guards accompanied you and were they armed A Your Honour I departed Samrong Pagoda to Kandal Pagoda in the company of two soldiers One rode the motorbike The other one carried an AK rifle sitting behind me So there were four people on that motorbike the soldier who rode the bike then myself another prisoner and then another soldier behind us   Q You stated that the Kandal Pagoda Prison was a zone prison Did you know who supervised that prison that zone prison Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A Your Honour I did not know that detail Q When you arrived at the Kandal Pagoda did the guards;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
at Kandal Pagoda Prison come to receive you Or were they the two militia men who took you there led you to the people at the Kandal Pagoda Prison A Your Honour at that time the two soldiers who took us there once the motorbike stopped three or four soldiers came out from the Pagoda It seems like they had a prearrangement So then when the motorbike stopped they tied my hands to the back Q Did they blindfold you or tie your hands to the back A My hands were tied to the back but I was not blindfolded Q Did they register your details and were you photographed A No not at that Kandal Pagoda Prison   Q Where did they take you after that A After they tied us up they split us Say Sarak was sent to the left and I was sent to the right direction into a room It used to be a former monk residence and inside that room there were already four detainees So they untied my hands and they shackled my legs There were five of us there at a time Q When did they interrogate you A Your Honour at about p m they came to call out the names and we were tied and taken away Q After returning from being interrogated were you still cuffed or uncuffed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
EAV Page A After we returned from being interrogated we lost our spirit They took off the cuffs and they shackled our legs Although we asked for water we were not given any Q From your statement you were detained at the Kandal Pagoda for seven days And the subsequent days were you being interrogated and tortured A Your Honour at the Wat Kandal I was interrogated once That was on the first day I was interrogated for one time only   Q What the food ration was like A The food at the Kandal Pagoda was for the row of the shackle and there were five or six of us We would be given one small cartridge container of gruel and they place it on the wooden shackle and if there were five of us there would be five spoons there And then they  theres a small pat of salt Sometimes they put it on that wooden shackle sometimes they put it on the bowl So we took a grain of salt each and we ate the gruel from that common pot together Q When you were taken out from the Kandal Pagoda Prison did you know which force or which group came to tell you and did you know  or if you know the unit of that group A Your Honour at that time I did not know anything or which unit or which force came to take me My name was called and the;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
truck was waiting for us So after they lift the cloth cover then we were boarded and then they verified the names of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page prisoners Then they uncovered the truck and we could not know which unit came to pick us up Q Did you look at the plate number of that truck A No I did not   Q In each truck how many guards were there A Your Honour from what I can recall in that truck there was a driver and a person who sat next to the driver There is one guard sitting on the roof and another guard sitting in the back with us They were all armed So in total the armed guards there were three armed guards plus the person sitting next to the driver So if I can recall it there were five of them altogether in one truck Q Did you ever think about the detention at the zone prison and at S Detention Centre Which one had worse conditions than the other one A Your Honour from the feeling that I had at the time that I came across three prisons and when I arrived at S while I was being photographed I had a feeling that that was a detention centre closer to the senior leadership and I had a slim hope that there might be;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
justice and that because we did not do anything wrong and if Angkar found that we didnt make any offence then we would be released That was the feeling I had at the time However after I entered the second floor of the D building two days later my hope just died Its gone That was also based Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page on the behaviours of the young prison guards so I completely lost my hope They degraded us Its indescribable the way they treated us the prisoners Sometimes when we laid down when they woke us up sometimes while it was just  while we were asleep they suddenly woke us up and if we could not sit up on time then they used their rubber  their tyre thongs to kick our heads   So with such a view for the last few days when I was there I lost my hope and when I compared my detentions to the sector and the zone prison I could not have any hope The situation the security was tight We were forbidden not to talk to any other inmates and that at S is where I really had the real test of being detained in the prison conditions My hope was zero JUDGE YA SOKHAN I have no more questions Mr President MR PRESIDENT Any Judges of the Bench have any;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
questions The floor now is given to Judge Thou Mony JUDGE THOU MONY Thank you Mr President BY JUDGE THOU MONY Q Uncle Vann Nath I want to clarify on a few points that you have stated this morning You told us you were detained at S for more than one month and after that you were assigned to draw Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page paintings Can you tell us the condition of your first detention and the condition after you were assigned to work as a painter A Your Honour the two conditions were completely different When I was upstairs as I said we had no rights If we were ordered to sleep we had to sleep We had to ask for permission for everything that we wanted to do However when I was on the ground floor I had certain freedoms I could move around freely in the workshop in that room That room was about three times or four times metres and if I wanted to go out of that room then I would need to ask permission from the guard who guarded outside that building that room   And for lunch or for taking a bath then we were  I was allowed to do that So the conditions were completely different Q What about resting at night Were you cuffed or shackled A Your Honour while I;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
was working on the ground floor I was no longer cuffed or shackled I had freedom I could sleep freely I was allowed to have a mat although it was not a new mat but yes indeed it still was a mat and I could use a mosquito net as a blanket Q So you were not cuffed or shackled However were you guarded strictly during the time you rested at night A When I rested on the upper floor together with other workshop people yes we were guarded strictly and we were checked almost every hour But later on when I rested in the workshop nobody Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page guarded me They locked us from the outside and we could rest in that workshop Q What about the food provisions Was there a difference between the time you were upstairs and the time you worked as a painter A Your Honour it was totally different Upstairs as I said earlier we only had a few spoons of gruel each time for each meal Downstairs in the workshop I could eat I could have my fill I had rice to eat so that was the difference   Q You stated this morning that when you worked as a painter a prisoner who declared that he was a real artist and could work quicker and at a better pace than you;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
 however he could not accomplish what he said so he was tortured by hanging and dropping into the jar as you illustrated in the drawing And it was done at night Besides that prisoner were there any other prisoners who were tortured the same way A Your Honour I only saw one incident of that prisoner I did not see any other prisoners involved in such torture Q Besides that one type of torture did you witness any other types of torture A No I did not see it personally however one day a prison guard from the interrogation unit brought a prisoner to be interrogated At that time I was mixing cement in order to build the sculpture of Brother number and the prisoner was Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page walked nearby to the window of the workshop and that guard asked me to pack some cement for him and I thought he would use it to fix a water jar or something So I gave it to him and he left Upon returning the person whom he walked before I handed him the cement I saw the cement on the head of that prisoner so I presumed that the cement was used on that prisoner However that was only my conclusion   JUDGE THOU MONY Thank you Mr President I do not have any more questions MR PRESIDENT The;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Chamber has already asked the questions to the witness and now I would like to give the floor to the CoProsecutors to put questions to the witness Vann Nath You are reminded that you have minutes to ask questions The floor is yours MR YET CHAKRIYA Thank you Mr President QUESTIONING BY THE COPROSECUTORS BY MR YET CHAKRIYA Q Mr Vann Nath besides Brother East did you know any other leading cadres at S A Mr CoProsecutor I knew Brother East he was the biggest person there Then Brother Mam Nai from the interrogation section Next as called by Brother East it was Comrade Pon I saw him occasionally And next Hor  Comrade Hor or Brother Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Hor as he was called at the time He was also a senior cadre although I was uncertain of his actual position I called him Brother West Some prison guards asked me if Brother Hor came to inspect the workshop so I said sometimes Brother West came to visit or if the accused came I would say Brother East came to visit Then there was a Comrade Peng from the Special Unit Suos Thy Bou They were from a separate unit but they used to come and go to visit the workshop This is from what I can recall Mr CoProsecutor   Q Thank you Did you see the annotation;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
of Duch quote that Keep for use temporarily And if you did see this annotation when did you see it A Mr CoProsecutor I saw that document after the liberation day of I think it was around At that time the documentation researchers examined those documents and when they saw my name they showed me the name and when I saw that annotation I felt that I had a fever I was shivering that I was removed to be used because from the list of more than people and on my name there was a red ink crossing out my name and in the bracket it was put Keep for use and the rest were smashed It was on the th or th of February  If without such an annotation then I would be gone Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q Did you think that was Duchs annotation A When I first saw the annotation  let me tell you Mr CoProsecutor previously I never knew the name of Duch I did not know that Brother East was actually Duch because I only knew him as Brother East So when I saw the name of Duch below the annotation  for example the annotation request to be smashed  then I was told that Duch that was the name of the chairman of the prison So then I realized that Duch was;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
actually Brother East and of course that was the annotation of Brother East   Q Did you think that Duch had the most power at S A Yes thats what I thought Q You confirmed to the Chamber this morning that when insects like grasshoppers fall nearby then they would grab and eat in order to fulfil the hunger that they had Did you used to eat those insects A Mr CoProsecutor I tried to eat too but I was not successful because where I was it was far from the light The light was near the window and I was at the other side so I did not catch the insects to eat MR YET CHAKRIYA Mr President I do not have any more questions I would like now to give the floor to my colleague MR PRESIDENT The international CoProsecutor you take the floor Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page MR PETIT Thank you Mr President BY MR PETIT Q Sir I only have a few questions for you   At the time of your initial arrest in your commune you had been living there for over two years now had you prior knowledge of other people being arrested and disappearing while you were living there And if so did these people have anything in common Were they part of a same group and what group was that A Mr;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
CoProsecutor in my cooperative the arrest was made on a regular basis every day every month but the people would be arrested from different locations Sometimes a few people would be arrested from one group and the other day people would be arrested from the other group and normally those who were arrested were the new people or the th of April socalled people And they thought that we were affiliated with the former regime either we were the students former soldiers or capitalists In conclusion we would be thought as the exploiting class which would be gotten rid of So the revolutionary thought that exploiting class would be the enemies of them so I myself would be waiting for being arrested like other Q I understand that the circumstances of your first and only interrogation at Wat Kandal was very difficult But can you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page recall for us or can you tell us if you think that at that time you confessed to anything or you simply cannot recall A I can remember some of the events and in my response if Im rather confused  of course because I was halfdead or halfalive and I was not yet tortured that I could still tell or confess something but then I could not remember after I was electrocuted When I was sitting on the chair then I was;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
asked why Angkar arrested me and I told him that I did not know anything because Angkar asked me to collect sheaves of rice and then I did not know anything other than that Then he said that Angkar knew too well already they were arrested any person by mistake so I better answer to them And I still insisted that I knew nothing wrong that I committed and I did not make any mistake at the fields and in my cooperative we did not have food and people only shared the communal meal   Like for families would eat just all together when we were offered the gruel and the gruel with a lot of water but less grain And people were so hungry that they had to pick up leaves to substitute their food and they would probably pick up the collected vegetables or property Thats why they might have the mistake by doing so And then he said that I did not need to even try to hide any mistake but they still said that I did something against the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Party by conducting meetings with the group and he asked me whether I had such meeting and where the meetings were taking place And I told him that you know I did not know anything about it How could I tell you about such;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
meetings So then I was electrocuted again and then I was unconscious and when I woke up I was interrogated and then I could not remember the people I wrote or confessed to them I was talking about myself rather than implicating other people in my confession Q Thank you I would now like to show you a picture with the Courts permission of Tuol Sleng an aerial photography to help us understand a little bit more your earlier testimony MR PETIT That picture Mr President can be found at ERN to Im not sure of the exact ERN of this particular picture but if we could have the A V Section put it on the monitors it will become clear as it is very familiar to us   This is part of the Zoran Lesic report expert report that was done for the investigation MR PRESIDENT Could you please confirm whether these ERN numbers are in French or in Khmer or English Could you please repeat it also MR PETIT These ERN numbers are for the Khmer version They are again to if Im not mistaken And they are as I Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page said part of the report done by Mr Lesic and show various takes of the location MR PRESIDENT The A V Unit could you please put the pictures or the photographs as suggested by the;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
CoProsecutor on the monitor Thank you MR PETIT Thank you BY MR PETIT Q Now sir this is an aerial photograph Can you tell us first if you recognize the location A Of course I remember the location   Q Thank you I had to ask that Can you tell us from your recollection if this shows the buildings of S as they were then when you were detained A If we talk about the premises the location of the buildings in this compound is of course this exact location It was there But now things have changed a little bit in the outside Q Thank you Can you tell us then when you first got to S in which building were you detained And you may use the letters that are represented on this picture to help us understand A I first was detained at Building D Q Thank you So in the morning during your testimony when you were referring to the Building D you were referring to the same Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page building that is identified with the letter here as the Building D correct Those are the same buildings A That is correct Q Thank you Now could you please for us identify where the workshop that you lived and worked in was located again if you can using the letters on the screen  ;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
A The building we lived and worked locates in the middle between Building B and C I could not see the middle letter that red letter Yes somewhere there So this line of buildings Q Would I be correct in saying that this is the line of buildings identified with the letter E where the pointer is now running up and down A Thats correct Q Thank you And your workshop more precisely where Duch would come to visit you almost every day will it be closer to the entrance which we see at the bottom of this line of buildings of closer to the back towards Building B and C Where was it A It was closer to the back of here the back No no not that far a little bit lower Yes in that location Q Thank you So therefore where the pointer is resting on this little blue dot there towards the end between building B and C is that correct A Thats correct Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q So am I to understand therefore that when Duch came to visit you almost every day he had therefore to walk across pretty much the main part of the compound to come to your workshop either through the building or around in the courtyard itself correct A Im not quite sure where he came to visit me I only;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
saw him through the window next to my workplace so I could not see further from that I could see his shadow because he was standing near that window so I could feel like he also  he already coming I didnt know where he came from   Q I apologize Perhaps my question wasnt clear If Duch was coming from outside the main compound by the main entrance at the bottom of this picture then he would have to cross most of the compound to come and visit you is that correct A Im not quite sure but I can conclude that he would come through the main entrance and walk along this path and then walk past this building  I mean the small path to reach me without crossing the other buildings Q Thank you Now during those visits the President asked you earlier how did Duch appear  but perhaps it wasnt  perhaps its the translation issue but it wasnt quite clear to me what the answer was So let me perhaps rephrase the Presidents question During those visits did at any time Duch appear to you to be Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page scared or depressed or somehow anxious Do you understand my question A I understand your question   At that time I had only a feeling that I had to paint the very;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
good portrait so that he would be happy and if he saw the good painting he was happy of course So it was part of my success because he appreciated my painting but when he came with less impression  I mean less interest then I was so afraid and nervous because I was afraid that he would be angry with me So when I did  I know that he did not show good feeling in his facial expression and I would be scared for having not done good job but I never  yeah thats all Q You were scared but did he at any time look scared to you Did he look like a scared anxious man to you at any time during that one year A S was his location and he was the boss and I did not know whether he would be scared of anything because he would be in control of everything and his subordinates had to be  had to respect him and fear him So I thought that he would be an intelligent and smart leader and I thought at that time that he would not  he would be nothing but the good leader in his time So everyone could never imagine that people would be taken away to be killed and we only thought that he would be a respectful person as a leader or boss and he never did anything that made us Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page scared of him Q Thank you Youve told us that some of the guards  or that there were concerns about possible suicide by prisoners such as taking away possible means things that you could use to commit suicide Did you yourself at any time witness an inmate committing suicide and if so could you tell us what you witnessed A I never witnessed any inmate committing suicide but we were for example asking for a string to tie our loose pants for example Then they would say that Angkar would not give you such a string because they were afraid that we would use them to commit suicide Thats what I learned   Q Thank you MR PRESIDENT Mr President I have a request to the Trial Chamber As you know you ruled on March th that a piece of video footage purported to be of Tuol Sleng a few days after its liberation would be placed on the case file That piece of footage as weve presented to you through oral and written submission came to be known after the investigation and indeed right before the commencement of this trial Due to observations from various parties you eventually ruled as I said on March th that the two segments of video footage  one purporting to show the location the second Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
 Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page purporting to show former child inmates  those videos would be placed on the case file and I quote subject to a review of the relevance and authenticity during the substantive hearing And you then directed the parties who so wished to do so to file written observations regarding those videos which if I recall the defence did and I believe other parties did We also have if Im not mistaken further a witness who would be able to assist us perhaps at least for one of those two pieces of evidence   Now much has been said much has been argued about this footage I would suggest following the guidance you gave us that we now have before us a witness who has by his own admission seen the location seen the scene of the crime so to speak within about seven days after its liberation and who could certainly  given his accurate and quite forceful testimony today  probably help us help you to ascertain the value of this footage to your judgement and to this trial As I said the parties have made their positions known You have decided that throughout the substantive hearing you would use whatever opportunity to evaluate this footage to eventually rule on it and use it if need be I would suggest therefore that we take this opportunity  this first opportunity  to have the witness;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
shown the first part of these two  the first of these two videos the one purported to show the Kampong as it was Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page then so that he may give us any comments that he may have on this footage so that perhaps we can resolve this issue and decide  you decide what to do with this footage in the future Thats my humble submission MR PRESIDENT There are two issues with different conditions We already advised the parties to the proceeding that all kinds of materials requested by the parties have already been decided to be included in the case file but they are valued as the materials However regarding the observations of whether the material can be used as evidence will be discussed in the second stage   Regarding this matter there has been objections from the defence counsel concerning the video footage in which they believe that it would be corrected or adjustment would have been made to the video footage that its original version would not be maintained So it is now about the rights to be discussed and whether it is to be put before the Court is another step I would like to also make it known to the international CoProsecutor that on the morning of Friday the Trial Chamber had already tried to discuss the remaining issues and among;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
them the Trial Chamber made the decision and we decided to delay the discussion on some particular issues and we are waiting for the matter to be raised by the CoProsecutor and by the parties and then the Chamber will make a decision whether we should discuss Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page this matter or not Because we still have the matter of two Vietnamese witnesses who have been requested by the parties to have them removed from the witness list and that the Chamber also needed to have this matter discussed I dont know whether you get my message because in the future proceedings the Trial Chamber will take into account this matter but we are not yet in the position to say whether this matter can be now discussed at this very session because the defence counsel still challenge the content of the video footage as they argue that the video footage would be  I mean adjustment would have been made and that the video had been produced by the Vietnamese people and the witness  the two witnesses involved in the video footage at the beginning were asked to be put in the witness list and later on were asked to be removed from the list Thats why the Trial Chamber is not yet in the position to discuss this matter at this moment yet   MR PETIT;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Thank you Mr President I gather therefore that the issue is not live or at least that the Trial Chamber does not wish at this point to entertain this issue and well therefore reserve our comments and observation at a later date Therefore I have no further questions but with your permission Mr President on behalf of the CoProsecution Id like to thank Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the witness for his testimony today and indeed for the testimony hes been giving for the last years Thank you MR PRESIDENT Next the Chamber would like to give the floor to the civil party lawyers starting from group first We would like to inform the civil parties that each group has minutes to put questions to the witness So civil party group the floor is yours MS STUDZINSKY I would like to make a request We have now and we expect a break of minutes That means we have still minutes and I think we have more time a little bit more time than only minutes for the remaining parties and therefore I would like to request to give us and finally the defence if needed the whole time and not like last Thursday that we finished already at lunchtime and had the whole afternoon without having the opportunity to ask questions Thank you Deliberation between Judges   MR PRESIDENT Thank you Ms;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Studzinsky for raising the matter up regarding the time allocations and that we might have a possible time but previously our proceedings were delayed due to the time taken to question the witnesses and thats because of the time allocation for questionings which were not strict And the time allocation as set out and instructed by the Chamber Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page is to expedite the proceedings in order to satisfy it also the public and the national and international opinions and for the fair justice As you have noted each party urges on the expedition of the proceedings and the Chamber itself has its discretion and already made its decision and its decision will not be amended to entertain your request The quicker the proceedings can go we will accept it but if there is any delays we will not take it The floor is now given to Hong Kimsuon MR HONG KIMSUON Thank you Mr President Your Honours QUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL BY MR HONG KIMSUON Q Uncle Vann Nath let me ask you a question You already informed the Chamber that when you walked to the back of the building  here I talk about the inner compound of S Detention Centre  and you met a female prisoner who said she lost her female character What does it mean Can you elaborate on this A Mr Lawyer;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the Khmer language for me I think the phrase used by her that she lost her nature her female nature or her female character due to the interrogation was known enough and I dont want to make any comment on this Q Thank you You already stated to the President regarding a painting that a female prisoner was tortured In that painting Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page it does not adequately depict the scene In the scene I saw a pinch or a plier was used to pinch her nipple and that she was stripped naked A On this matter I cannot elaborate further because I myself did not witness the interrogation of that female prisoner However it is a depiction of what was described to me by that female prisoner Its not possible to draw something that we cannot see   Q Thank you You also said that you heard the screaming or the crying of young children or adult prisoners Did you yourself see at a later stage that some guards took the children away and out How many children were taken out and what was the range of their age A I did not see the incident by myself I heard the screaming and the beating  the sounds of the beating out the crying of both adult and young people and the children were taken away It was;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
irregular regarding the number Sometimes there were five people or sometimes eight sometimes three As for the young children or the children it was hard to estimate their age It was irregular Sometimes a young baby was taken away the baby was about six to seven months Sometimes a child was walked or sometimes two children were walked together So the age of the children varied So this is my response Mr Lawyer Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q Thank you You also informed the Chamber that the children were walked or a baby was handled was carried Were they taken into the room or were they taken out by the guards A The guards took them out from Building C walking passing my workplace to go outside But because I could not see further I did not know where they were taken out   Q Thank you Another question You already informed the Chamber but I would like to confirm that when the guards asked for someone who knows how to paint you already described that and you said that you saw Brother East coming to visit your workshop almost on a daily basis Does it mean from the day you started doing the painting A Mr Lawyer it was started from I received a plan imposed by him He often came to inspect the workshop Most of the time usually;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
he came in the afternoon or in the evening sometimes at or p m He rarely came in the morning Q Thank you So this means he came to inspect the workshop since you were authorized to work in the workshop That was lets say you were arrested on the th of January  and until the day you were released and assigned to the painting it was like more than one month in January or February  so from that day that Duch or Brother East came often to visit you at the workshop A Yes That was the time Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q Thank you On the matter that guards took you into the room when you first arrived at the centre that were your clothes changed from the time you arrived It means your old clothes were taken and they gave you the new set of clothes and they take out the string to tighten the waist   A Mr Lawyer on that issue when we entered those who had black clothes had to be taken off For the rest of other clothes we could keep them but what was given to those whose black clothes were taken they gave you coloured clothes a shorts and most of those shorts had no string to tighten their waist So it was why we wore the skirt Q I;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
understand that Thank you Let me continue In response to the CoInvestigating Judges you described in detail but let me summarise that you saw the guards taking people out but you were not sure of where they were taken You presumed that they were being integrated into the cooperative but the question is that when you saw the people taken out of the S office was it done during the day or the nighttime And how many each time A Mr Lawyer regarding the movement of prisoners actually it was done almost on a daily basis However the amount of prisoners taken in or out varied It was the main daily operation of the centre Sometimes prisoners were transferred from one building to another people were moved because new Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page prisoners come in and some of the prisoners were taken out so it was a busy activity as part of the daily operation of the centre And at night I did not see people were taken out I only saw people were taken out usually in the afternoon But where they were taken I was not sure because I only stay in the room where I worked But usually yes the taking out was done usually at or p m in the afternoon Sometimes it was done in the morning   Q Thank you My next question is;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
related to your response to the Chamber You said you went to the workshop at the back and you saw a person putting ants into a box full of centipedes Was that location close to where you painted the painting or was it behind Building B or C A Mr Lawyer regarding the geographical location of S it was quite spread at the time Behind Building B and C there were a barbed wire fence The front was built in the shape of a house roof and I believe the fence  the electricity was used on the fence to defend the building And if you crossed that fence there would be a workshop a kitchen and a pig pen So it was quite large and the length of that area was quite as wide as the S It used to be a Tuol Sleng market So the ground of that high school was used as part of the workshop also for pig pen kitchen but they were in different Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page segments And for the young guards who went to see the old guard who fed the centipedes with ants it was not far from the place where he works in the wood workshop So usually he fed the centipedes with those ants The centipede was the size of an index finger So that was the location which was;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
at a different location from the place where I worked in the workshop It means we had to cross that fence with electricity before we could reach the other side   MR PRESIDENT Mr Lawyer your time runs out And now the Chamber will take a minute break until p m when we will resume and continue the proceedings Court official could you assist the witness with some refreshment in a resting room in a waiting room and bring him back at pm Judges exit courtroom Court recesses from H to H Judges enter courtroom MR PRESIDENT Please be seated The Court is now back in session Next we would like to give the floor to the civil parties lawyers group Correction please group first Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   MR KIM MENGKHY Dear Mr President Your Honours and the parties to the proceeding my name is Kim Mengkhy representing civil party group on behalf of the victims and the civil parties BY KIM MENGKHY Q I would like to thank you Uncle Vann Nath for being with us the full day to give your testimony My first question is in the name of a survivor or surviving evidence are your bored with the repetitious questions about your sufferings A Mr Mengkhy I have thought about this but sometimes I am bored However it is about revealing the truth and;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
telling the younger generation about the details of the event and by doing so it can help me feel relaxed a little bit too So by doing so I believe that the boredom fades away Q Thank you for your clarification My next question is you said you would like to tell the world about what happened during your life as a victim and a survivor of S Can you tell us that during the times when you were arrested and sent all the way from Battambang to S and that you did not make any mistake and that you tried to tell them that you did not make any mistake but they still pressed you to answer to confess So what did you feel or how did you feel about it Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A All prisoners during that regime of the three years eight months and days witnessed all the sufferings and the difficulties and most of us did not make any wrongdoings and that we were made to confess to our mistakes that we never committed   The most painful experience is that we had to make up the stories to cheat on us on ourselves in order to survive in order to get away from being tortured if we failed to do so Sometimes this could lead to death Q After you have survived the execution;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
during the regime and for the last years or more you said that young generations have not believed what you have told them So what do you do if people still are not convinced of your testimony A This happens but not very often Through my experience during big gatherings some children asked me about this and I told them about the event and they just challenged me  why they did not hear the details of what happened from their parents  and I just told them that maybe they were so moved and shocked that they did not want to recall the past to only reopen the old wounds and sufferings Thats why the parents tend to keep quiet and not telling their younger generations about this Thats why children were not convinced of what happened And having noticed that I tried my best to tell them and to point them to research some remaining Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page or surviving documents at almost every place including S to understand more about the past I have felt that young people and intellectuals are getting familiar with this story and they would conduct further research to be fully informed of the regime   Q Thank you Next if your testimony is not believed by the accused what would happen then MR PRESIDENT You dont need to answer this question because;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
such question should be avoided Please ask the question that is related to the fact and has the evidentiary evidence so that the Chamber can really value it in our decision so that the truth is found MR KIM MENGKHY Thank you Mr President I would like to rephrase it BY MR KIM MENGKHY Q You said that your life during the regime was more like between animal and human being So in which part was your life come between the two A It is only the comparison of our life during that time because we were entitled the status as human beings although we were detained then we would be treated different from animals because even animals domestic animals would be fed or would be given food and would never been kicked days and nights like that When human being was deprived of their movement and we were Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page inflicted with tortures physically and mentally and thats why I could l presume that we were between animals and human beings Thats only my presumption Q Thank you Uncle MR KIM MENGKHY The civil party lawyers group have no further questions And thank you very much for your response   MR PRESIDENT I would like to give the floor to the civil party lawyers group MR KONG PISEY Thank you Mr President and Your Honours and the parties;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
to the proceeding I would like to thank you the witness for his time in this session I would like to put questions to Mr Vann Nath BY MR KONG PISEY Q The question is you told the Judges already that the Brother East frequently visited your workshop So when he paid such a visit did you hear any shouts or screams from the outside A The screams of the prisoners who were being tortured could be heard sometimes For example in the morning or in the afternoons normally during the working hours We worked  people worked three shifts and sometimes there was a scream and I did not really care whether I expected to hear the scream of the prisoners when he was paying me a visit So I did not take Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page any notice regarding this matter Q Thank you So you had heard the screams during several occasions even during the time when Brother East paid you a visit Do I understand that correctly   A Im not quite sure whether when he stood there and that simultaneously I heard the screamings from the prisoner so Im not quite sure about it Q Thank you The next question I would like you to tell us when you were painting the pictures the paintings of the tortures what made you write  or paint such;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
portraits or such pictures A Mr Lawyer I think if I am not mistaken you asked me that Brother East did never  did not ask me to draw or paint any picture of tortures He only asked me to draw the portrait or the portrait of Pol Pot and I draw these latest pictures of the tortures after after the country was liberated and during that regime I only painted the portraits of the leaders   Q Thank you Because I noticed in the photo  in the pictures you painted the date was dated back to and I didnt realize that they were painted after So I would like to ask you another question When you were tortured at the detention were there any conditions imposed on you while being tortured Because you made Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page a statement before the CoInvestigating Judges that during the interrogation they would put the plastic bag to cover your face So could you please elaborate on this a little bit further And that statement is D  A Im afraid that I never used the term plastic bag and that I was inflicted with a plastic bag I did say that an electric wire was attached to my pants and that I was electrocuted until I went unconscious and then the water would be splashed on me until I could recover;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
and then interrogation would continue I only told the Judges that when I entered that interrogation room I saw the blood stains on the floor I saw the torturing implements but I was not tortured with those implements except the electrocution Q Thank you I just raised this matter D  was about the testimony you made before the CoInvestigating Judges about the mask that was used to cover your face and that I dont know why you did not confirm this what you have already stated before the CoInvestigating Judges A Mr Lawyer once again Im afraid I never made such statement before the CoInvestigating Judges Maybe the other people did so   Q I would like to correct my message It was not before the CoInvestigating Judges but before the CoProsecutors My next question is you said this morning that you had an Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page opportunity to walk past the individual cells Did you see anything inside those individual cells A The pathway to the place where I took a rest at night was the corridor right in front of those opened windows so I could glance at the cells but I did not have the right to inspect inside each cell Q Thank you So I would like now to proceed to another question This morning you stated that among the people of them were stripped;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
of their clothes and some were left without even underwear My question is that how long were people made to be naked without the underwear before they were given such underwear A I think when we approached the location there were not about the people People who wore black clothes had to remove them and give them to the guards and those with underwear could have the underwear Those who had the pants without underwear but the black clothes had to remove the black clothes and left naked until the guards would bring our new clothes But maybe just a few two or three of them would be left without clothes on   Q Thank you In your book page line you said among the people there were of them so I just quoted from your book A Maybe in the book I would have said so but I think  I dont Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page know whether the English translation is correct Among the people there were only left when four disappeared so I think the most important thing is that the black clothes would not be left with us So whether we had any other clothes with us while the black clothes would be removed then we were left with just those clothes MR PRESIDENT Mr Lawyer your time has run out Civil party lawyers group the floor;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
is yours now MR WERNER Thank you Mr President BY MR WERNER Q Hello Please allow me to tell you that we are very much grateful for your testimony That was the first thing that I wanted to share with you I have a first question for you concerning Mr Bou Meng and you answered this morning to Judge Lavergne concerning what had happened with Mr Bou Meng and you said  well we dont have the transcript here but you said that you  when you saw Bou Meng come back into the workshop after two weeks he was pale he had long hair and he was tied  chained by his neck and by his legs and in your book which was mentioned earlier by one of my colleagues you also mentioned on page  you mentioned Bou Meng carrying bandages all over his bloody wounds all over his emaciated body Can you remember this Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A I still remember it clearly Q And in the same segment on page you added that in your presence the accused beat Bou Meng in his head with his foot and that Bou Meng fell to the floor that he kicked him in the head and that Bou Meng fell to the floor Do you remember that A Of course I do Q Thank you I have another question concerning;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the centipedes You answered the judges about this and you said this morning that a guard told you that he was in charge of feeding centipedes Do you remember the name of this guard who was feeding centipedes A It was not the guard It was the same prisoner He was a carpenter not the guard   Q Did this prisoner explain to you exactly how the centipedes were used or were going to be used A Im not quite sure I know this but he said that there was a guard who ordered him to feed the centipedes and that guard belonged to the interrogation team So when I observed that he raised centipedes I only learned from the guard  from him the carpenter but I knew nothing more about this Q Thank you for this Before the CoInvestigating Judge  and I will refer to document D on the th of January The CoInvestigating Judge was questioning you on other torture methods and you said that you had learned from a prisoner called Pha Tha Chan that Pha Tha Chan would have been placed into a Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page refrigerator Can you remember that A I do remember Q And what exactly did he say to you A I had known him only for a short period of time He worked as an interpreter and I worked;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
in the workshop as a painter We met only at night briefly So he told me that he was made to be immersed into that bathtub   He didnt say that it was ice water He only told me that it was normal water in that bathtub and his legs and hands were cuffed and his head were plunged into the water until he absorbed water or choked with the water and then they would kick on his stomach so that the water would be vomited out from inside And after he met me and asked me to produce or to paint a picture to commemorate that event And before the drawing of the picture as I already told the Judges this morning the East Germany men asked  who was in the process of pursuing the film and thats why I could produce such paintings Q Thank you And during these months you were able  so you painted sculpted at S was months and you said that even if the detention conditions were better of course than in the collective cell however you were working in a constant atmosphere of terror and of fear Is that so A As the prisoners we lived with constant fear Its normal Q My last question Were you told were you explained why you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the artists were made to;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
work in a premise within S within the cries of the people who were being tortured and not outside of S so that you would be able to create peacefully and calmly Were you explained why A I dont know this matter for sure and I was not explained well about this because when we were uncuffed we were  I was happy I could eat and I could move and my feeling was good at that time And although I was detained it was not a problem I just tried to work hard and respected the orders of the Angkar and I was shocked somehow when I heard the screaming However I got used to it   Q I no longer have any further questions Thank you very much and I wish you all the best and all the best for your health Thank you MR PRESIDENT Next I would like to give the floor to put questions to this survivor to the defence counsel If you have questions the floor now is open for the defence counsel MR KAR SAVUTH Thank you Mr President QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL BY MR KAR SAVUTH Q Brother Vann Nath I would like to seek some clarification from you When a sculptor boasted about his skill but in fact he Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page could not work at that time Duch had him;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
returned At that time Duch did not order him to be tortured Is that so Can you answer that A Mr Lawyer Duch did not order it as you said Q Thank you So when guards tortured him was Duch aware that the guards tortured him without his knowledge A Mr Lawyer I did not know the details of this matter However when he walked out the guards took the prisoner out so they went in a separate way So I did not know whether Duch knew of the torture or not Q Thank you Another question for clarification Besides the sculptor who was tortured by hanging from that rope was that rope tied and placed there permanently or it was only hanged there once to torture that sculptor A Mr Lawyer if we talk about that rope the rope was there permanently It was only a year after the liberation it was there as well So when I saw it it was there and the sculptor was tortured there on that rope This is my response to you Mr Lawyer   Q Thank you About the tombs at S you confirmed today that you did not witness personally how many dead bodies but because you saw the tombs you presumed that there were dead bodies is that so Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A Let me tell you that at S;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
I entered twice first time it was on the th of January So because when I fled I did not have any clothes so the four of us went inside the centre again to find some clothes but because of the bad smell from the dead bodies we did not really go inside At that time we didnt pay attention to how many dead bodies were there The next entry it was in November  after it was already cleaned up and there were tombs there so I concluded that there were dead bodies and of course I am not sure how many dead bodies in each tomb Q Thank you My fourth question Did you ever see Brother East  that is Duch  torture any prisoner during the time that you were there A Mr Lawyer for serious torture no But for kicking  because I dont want to say because I dont think its a torture  but just for kicking I saw it but not for serious beating up   Q Thank you At S you stayed there for one year Did you see the regulations or the disciplines displayed on the board A The regulations of the Santebal on the board I only saw it after the liberation because I had no authority to walk through that interrogation area so I did not know where the board was or Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No ;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
 ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page at which room However the meanings of those regulations yes were created by the interrogation unit who made such regulations because I used to hear some of those regulations so I believe the interrogation unit was the one who imposed such regulations Q Thank you Did you ever see female prisoners jump from the upper floor to commit suicide A Mr Lawyer I saw one incident of such case It was before me about two metres it happened before me Q Can I ask you further Previously you stated in response to the CoProsecutors questions that you were strictly guarded and that people who were interred would be handcuffed or shackled However if the guards did not pay attention and if prisoners were cuffed or shackled how could a prisoner jump   A Mr Lawyer I would like to elaborate in detail on this matter so that you are clear That prisoner was female prisoner and usually for female prisoners in the common rooms most of them were not handcuffed or cuffed At that time I did not live on the ground floor I lived on the upper floor adjacent to that female prisoners room and interrogation team was on the ground floor And then a guard was ordered by them to bring me down  there were two of them  and another guard was ordered to bring the female prisoner down So the guard on the upper floor unlocked the;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
door and then while Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page she was near the door he turned and unlocked my door While the guard was unlocking my door the female prisoner jumped And at that time the fence  the barbed wire there was only three or four lines it was not so full like it is now So when I reached the door she jumped about the wire  the wire fence onto the ground floor and she broke her head and died So then the guard pulled me back into the room and locked me  and locked the door So I did not come out of the room And about one and a half or two hours later then I was taken to the ground floor and that was the incident that I witnessed Q Thank you I finished my question and now I would like to give the floor to my colleague MR PRESIDENT The defence counsel the floor is yours MS CANIZARES Thank you Mr President   BY MS CANIZARES Q Sir you have described the conditions under which you lived at S Could you please tell us why you did not wish to join as a civil party A Ms Lawyer people have different ideas have different purposes and objectives First my main concern was my health that I would not be able to attend regularly during;1;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
the trial proceedings Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Secondly I believe this is not my own personal matter It is a matter for my whole Cambodian people So I would not be able to want to apply to be a civil party because I think I would not be able to come to attend the hearings regularly And if the Court wishes to have me as a witness yes I am willing to provide testimony Thats why I do not write a complaint to become a civil party And usually people who makes the complaint would have an objective to seek for reparation I myself personally I do not want to seek for any reparation And if the trial needs me at any time of their convenience then I am ready to provide my testimony MR KONG PISEY Mr President I would seek your permission to  I would seek your instruction to advise the defence counsel to ask questions only related to the fact before us in the Chamber this afternoon Thank you   MR PRESIDENT Unfortunately the objection was too late seeing the witness already responded to the question I think it is quite proper that the question was asked because it is an exception why he did not want to be a civil party Defence counsel you may continue BY MS CANIZARES Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009
Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q A question was put to you by Judge Lavergne this morning and you answered that it was important for you to be in a position to bear witness so that the younger generations may know of the suffering experienced by the older generations so that these historic events would not repeat themselves And you also said that what you wanted out of this trial would be justice to be made   Do you think that the position of the accused who does acknowledge the great majority  the overwhelming majority of crimes that are charged to him and his regrets can help you and the other victims believe that justice has been done at least in part MR PETIT Apologies but where are we going with this This question is perhaps a form of pleading possibly but it is definitely outside the scope and the expertise lets say and the knowledge the frame of knowledge of the witness It may amount to a very nicelooking statement but its not a question to be put to a witness as to the facts I would for myself opine that it is not relevant and should be denied MR PRESIDENT Thank you for the CoProsecutors observation The Chamber thinks it is appropriate So the defence counsel you cannot ask this question and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case;0;1;Vann Nath;E1_39.1_TR001_20090629_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;29.06.2009

I knew then I was transferred to Orussei So when we were at Russei Keo there were six of us but when I was transferred to Orussei I was instructed to collect the tools from the houses in order to put them in the warehouse Then Comrade Kun asked me whether I could fix the loudspeaker and I told him yes so I was asked to repair the loudspeakers in the middle of the Orussei market So I fixed those loudspeakers for about three or four months and later on we were told that we no longer needed to collect those tools instead Angkar required us to collect sewing machines in order to sew black clothes So we collected sewing machines All together we collected sewing machines and after that we saw female  we saw women who came to that factory to sew the black clothes There were about women and roughly men to the sewing machine factory So we started working there from  until  and in  this is  I just briefly summarize the event I was ordered to repair vehicles in Vietnam thats what I was told but before they told me that Comrade Kun who was my boss was already Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page arrested And then Choum came to replace him and a few months later Choum was arrested and replaced by Comrade Yung;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

up and I was walked to the stairs and then they pulled my earlobe to go down and instructed me that You you go down So I went down to the staff building Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page So whenever I had to go up the stair my earlobe was pulled up and when I reached a room I was ordered to sit Then my legs were shackled and the handcuffs were taken off After I was unblindfolded I saw the fresh blood nearby I didnt know which person the blood belonged to And then later on they started to interrogate me They asked me to tell them the truth how many of us joined the CIA and KGB and I put my hands together and pleaded them to spare my life and they told me not to do that to them because they were not monks   And then I told them I did not know any CIA or KGB and truly I did not know these terms I heard of them but I never knew the roles of those people And then I asked them again to  I used the term Lok or Mister and using the term resulted in the beatings like lashes and then I did not know how I could ask them for forgiveness so I called them Brother So before I could use the term;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
Brother then I were inflicted with lashes already and then they started to interrogate me further One day while I was being interrogated and then they were beating me and then I put my hands up to protect myself then it broke my fingers And one day they removed my nails from the toes and I was trembling in pain And later on about days later I was electrocuted It was the direct electrical wire Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page from the wall attached to the very fresh current not the one like Duch mentioned about electric telephone or something like that So then I was electrocuted and I could hear some kind of sound in my ears and the person who beat me up called Contemptible Sieng  Im sorry to say Contemptible Sieng  and Hor Hor has a scar on his cheek But after my research I found out that three of them already died So I would like to tell this to Duch that Duch did not beat me personally directly otherwise he would not have the day to see the sunlight I just would like to be frank   Q Uncle Chum Mey please be wellbehaved and make sure that you be more ethical and try to avoid attacking any individual because it is more about the legal proceedings And the Trial Chamber appreciates your time to;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

accounts what I have remembered If Im not telling the truth then it would not be good to be here   Q Thank you very much Mr Chum Mey for your testimony but when you stated something that is about  for example you referred to Duch that if Duch beat you during the interrogation then he would not live today so I think this is not really appropriate to say so in the Court Of course the Court really values your testimony and we would like you just to refrain from being abusive insulting the accused or other individuals and we only would like you to refrain from using some terms that we view that are not Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page appropriate So you can please continue A Later on I was beaten up for a period of nights and days so I would be beaten days and night At p m I would be taken to the south building to the top floor and I was walked to the place where there was a generator and then I stepped on the lying lock and then they hold me by my hand and scolded me for being blinded that I could not see anything and walked like that So my earlobes hurt so much because they pulled them up and down almost every day Regarding the food they gave us;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
a very thin gruel and at p m they would come back and take me to be interrogated and beaten up again to ask me about the CIA and KGB Although I kept saying that I did not know anything about them they kept asking me for them At p m one of the guards came and told me  to tell me to let them know that I had to ask permission if I would like to change to a side when I was sleeping Otherwise they would see they would perceive that I try to break the chain And then Thy came and asked who was the guy who is from Orussei and whether he could fix sewing machines So then I said I could Then he said Okay good Tomorrow then you could work on fixing the sewing machines but try not to escape Otherwise you would be shot  Then I said I would not escape and then they gave me a set of clothes and I started to work at the workshop And then there Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page was a stack of clothes and they asked me to help look after the fire that they used to cook the gruel And then after the gruel was offered to the other people then I was allowed to eat the remaining   Then I tried to make;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
use of the remaining of the gruel to complement my hunger They asked me not to let the brothers know about this otherwise I would be beaten up Then I met Mr Pech and Pech worked with me in the former regime as a mechanic like I was We did not talk to one another We didnt dare talk to one another And we would work to fix the sewing machines about sewing machines Then they asked whether I could fix the typewriter And then I said I could so I fixed two typewriters for them and later on I was asked to fix the plumbing machine So I said I could fix all kinds of machines So later on they asked me to teach females the women to know about this And one day I heard the sound of the planes and three days later the guards prepared some vests you know with ammunition and weapons At the beginning they were not prepared but after hearing the sound like the bomb drops from the planes thats why these people were prepared And later on we heard the sound of a tank rolling from Chbar Ampov and we heard the bombardments And then one guy was on a motorbike who told us that the situation was Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page not good and they asked us to go back home but I;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
was very frustrated because I did not know where I would go Pech went into the workshop where Vann Nath was painting and the rest also entered the room I was the last person to go to that room and then I was scolded like the matter of fact of why I was so late to arrive there And there were two young children and I asked a woman who these children belong to They said they were the sons of Grandfather Cheng On And then I left   While we were inside the room we saw four of them with a hand grenade in their hands and I tried to hide myself to protect myself from being hurt by the grenade if it exploded So then when we left the building we noticed that the tanks already left to the east but we were walked at gunpoint and they asked us not to run away They asked us to walk Then we went into a villa for a long period of time before they asked us to move to the Chinese Embassy Then we moved to Wat Sansam Kosal We still heard the airplanes and aerial bombardments At dusk we were walked to Chamkar Dong and I think I got lost probably because we were sitting somewhere like at Boeng Choeung Ek and I could smell something and then we went to Prey Sar It was so quiet at Prey Sar and at dawn we proceeded further and;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
then we reached Ang Snuol at about a m and I saw my family my Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page wife I did not know how she was sent to Prey Sar and I saw a few other women at that watermelon plantation Then I asked them if I could carry my child and we walked to the other side of the road and while we were crossing the road Vietnamese CMC trucks with people on the truck shot at us and then we were separated Pech and Vann Nath returned while we were proceeding ahead with Dy Phon phonetic the dentist to Amleang They already ran away from us and no one was guarding us There were only three of us left Ta Eng from Kampong Cham and my family So altogether there were three people who walked far behind the others   Then we went to Srah Tol Pagoda and we asked the people there if we could have some rice so that we can cook them and eat Then we saw about Khmer Rouge soldiers at Sra Tol Pagoda and they asked us where we were from and I said we were from the sewing unit and they asked where we were originally from We said that we were from the east and then they said Okay stay here for a while  and wait until we got the;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
letters from the Angkar Then we would proceed further I think it was about at p m at night or maybe p m the soldiers left us and one militia was armed and was seen walking around us And then there were another three people with AK s who came and asked where were the three people to be killed and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page the militia said well they were still lying down there And then I woke up and then they told us that now weve got the letter from Angkar that we could move further and they asked the women to walk ahead first because women tend to walk slower than men Then we left the pagoda About one kilometre from the pagoda during our journey they shot They opened fire on my family during the night with a full moon then my wife told me to run away because they opened fire on us Then Ta Eng was also shot at and Ta Eng collapsed and he told me while being  collapsing actually  he asked me to run away because the soldier was shooting at us Then after a moment of quietness then I hid myself near the termite mound and they could not find us I could hear some people saying that the guy was hiding near that termite mound but actually I had escaped;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
to a nearby location already I would have been killed if I wasnt near the mound Then I ran further and entered a jungle and at night I started to run again And then at dawn we would hide ourselves in the jungle only to proceed further when dark came Then I met a woman I asked her whether we reached Thmat Pong Then I was told that Thmat Pong was far behind us now we reached Amleang And I knew that Amleang would not be the best location because those people told us that we would be sent to Amleang   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page So we  I tried to come back And I had not had any water I was so thirsty and we went without water for a few days And then we reached Phum Thom or Phum Thom Village near Thmat Pong and we told  and we asked other people whether we are reaching Amleang and they told us we are close So only when I could get to Thmat Pong that we  I could recognize where I could come back to Phnom Penh So a lot of other people were evacuated and driven away by the soldiers So I was carrying a machete a long knife and then I tried to cut sugar cane to substitute the water that I had been very;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
thirsty for quite a long time And then we walked further and then we reached Kdann Roy village We met about soldiers and we saw that a group of villagers was still under their control Then I walked toward them and with a machete I knew for sure that whatever happened I would try to defend myself with the weapon Then I reached a location called Snao I stated that I came to see my child but actually the child was not there It was just a pretext Then later on I met my family I met the woman who worked at the sewing unit with my wife and then we worked together to collect rice to put them in the barn And then I hide again in the barn At that time I was so scared of the Vietnamese and we lived in Baek Chan for some time I was called to attend a meeting and I went together with other people and then I asked if I could Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page become a soldier and they said no And then I said if I could be recruited as a soldier I would be deployed at Thra Tol but they said no   Q When the Khmer Rouge employed you to work in Phnom Penh what happened to your wife Was she reunited with you in Phnom Penh A;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

your nails were also pulled and you were also electrocuted So I want to know specifically the different types of torture Regarding the sticks how many times A They used the stick to beat me up every single day during that period They always had a bunch of the sticks ready at the corner of a table And on that table they had a typewriter on it and a bunch of sticks just lying nearby so after I was interrogated and beaten then the person came back to type and after that the same process continued So they always had a bunch of sticks ready near the table where they put the typewriter on   Q When they interrogated you what was the main focus of the interrogation What did they want from you during that interrogation A At that time they asked me about the KGB and CIA That was the main focus nothing else And if we answered about other things then I would be beaten and if I talked about Kampuchea Krom for example I was not allowed they would beat me up Q And on which session that during that interrogations that your toenails were pulled on which day A I cannot recall the exact day However talking about the nailpulling I think it was about one week into the period of Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page interrogation;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
Q So it means you were beaten and tortured for interrogation and during the process of that torture about a week later your nails were pulled Can you describe clearly in details the way or how they pulled your nails during that interrogation A Mr President the beating with the stick was on a daily basis They had a bunch of the sticks ready So I raised my left hand to defend myself and one of my fingers was broken but because I kept the same response that I did not know anything about the KGB or the CIA then they used a plier to twist my toenail and because it was not pulled out then the person pulled out my toenail   Q So they did not have to use any extra equipment because your legs were already shackled so they used a pinch or a plier to squeeze on your toenail and then they pulled it out Did the nail detach A Mr President yes the nail was completely detached from my toe They twisted the nail with the plier and because the nail did not come out so they pull out Q You mean the entire nail was pulled out or only just part of the nail was pulled out A Mr President actually its the entire nail was detached from the toe Q Did the nail grow Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
KAING GUEK EAV Page A Yes but it was not in formity phonetic It was deformed It grew back but it was deformed Q Can you show us that nail or that toe with the deformed nail That should be it A Microphone not activated MR PRESIDENT The interpreter can not hear the witness   BY MR PRESIDENT Q You mean the toes from  on both feet were pulled out Witness approaches the Bench MR PRESIDENT The AV Unit can you zoom into the toes of the witness You can now go back to the table Thank you BY MR PRESIDENT Q So when they tortured you they used pliers to squeeze and pull out your nail They did on both toes of your feet is that correct A Yes that is correct Q The toe pulling  was it done just in one session or was it done in a subsequent session as well A On one day one side of the nails were pulled and the other side was pulled out the next day Q When you were interrogated with torture in the form of electrocution how many times did they electrocute you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A Mr President I was electrocuted twice and I fell unconscious for both times   Q You stated that the electrocution was not in the same form as stated by;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
the accused that is without using the dynamo winding manually but actually the electricity was a full current volts from the wall outlet That is the normal voltage used in the office is that correct So they used one wire to put into your ear A Yes when one wire was put into my ear and when I fell unconscious they pulled the wire out Q The accused said the method of electrocution was only in the form of manual winding dynamo but in real practice the interrogator actually used the current the voltage from the wall outlet But from what the accused said the original plan was to use the manually winding dynamo but then if the volt outlet was used by the interrogator probably it was done by the interrogators and without his knowledge My next question to you is that during the times that you were tortured for example when you were beaten up with a lot of lashes or when your nails were pulled out or when you were electrocuted a moment after the torture did they have any medics to fix your wound A No there were no medics to come and check up on me I could even hardly walk Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q You said on the th of January at a m the situation was changed so you gathered together with other survivors;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

nights and after that they stopped interrogating you What was the reason for stopping the interrogation A They stopped interrogating me because I confessed that I joined the CIA and the KGB It was due to my confession Q Why did they believe your confession Did you implicate other people Because in the form of interrogation on the biography and then your personal activities and then the activities of your network or the traitorous network and that was a part of the structure of the confessions Was the form of the interrogation on you in a similar way talking about your own activities and the activities of your network A Mr President I confessed that I did join the CIA or the KGB but actually it was a fabrication because I was beaten so severely so I just implicated other people Q We understand on the truthfulness of the confession but we wanted to know about whether after the confession was extracted then they stopped torturing you So they interrogated you and then you made a false confession that you acknowledged that you were part of a CIA or KGB network with your own traitorous network and you just used names of various other people in order to avoid being tortured Is that correct A That is very correct Mr President Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q You entered S Do you recall;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

was taken away to be executed and that at the location there were about children who were detained and I saw a very old lady who was detained I did not know how this old lady and the young children could end up being CIA or KGB agents So I could presume that what they were doing was to really eliminate a race Q When you say that children were detained and your twomonth old child was taken away are you talking about Prey Sar or S A When I left S I met my wife at Prey Sar further from Prey Sar It was Ang Snuol area and my wife already gave birth to my son and we met three women and I asked if I could carry the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page baby Then we crossed the road to the other side  to the north of course  and then there were two Vietnamese trucks and then people fired from the trucks on us and we were separated and I went to the north with Grandfather Eng and Grandfather Dy Phon   Q Thank you Its probably a translation problem but may I just clarify Were you carrying your twomonth old son after you met your wife and the three women or was this some other persons child A Your Honour I was carrying my own son at;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

I was lost And its about dawn I went back and hide myself in the bush and then when it was dark I continued running again for three nights in a row So on the third night I saw two women carrying a basket of rice on their head and I asked them whether I was almost near Thmat Pong and I was told that No its wrong You are almost reaching Amleang and Thmat Pong was behind  So I ran back After I ran back when it was light then I went and hide myself in the forest and when its dark I continued running again And when I almost reach Thmat Pong Mountains  its called Phum Thom Village  after I asked them they told me that its not far  that Thmat Pong was not far  and that was about or a m So I made my trip to Thmat Pong Mountain and at the base of the Thmat Pong Mountains  when I left there were a lot of people living on the base of the mountain but when I went back nobody was there all gone So I went into a hut and I found a long knife and I took the knife and carried the knife and I cut two sugar canes I ate the sugar canes and I almost swallowed the sugar canes after I sucks at the juice because I was so hungry So I took the same path;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

not even weeping even just whispering we were not allowed We were not allowed to make any noise When I wept I could not make any noise I wept a lot and I had no more tears to weep I was only waiting for the day that I would be killed at that time Q Thank you MR HONG KIMSUON Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Mr President I would like now to give the floor to my international lawyer MR PRESIDENT The international lawyer the floor is yours MS STUDZINSKY Thank you Mr President BY MS STUDZINSKY Q Good afternoon Mr Chum Mey I have only a few questions and would like to start with the cell that we have seen from the reenactment Could you describe a little bit more how were the circumstances when you were in this cell For example was it dark had you light how was the exact size of the cell Could you elaborate a little bit on this Thank you A Ms Lawyer in that individual cell when I entered there was a cartridge case and a plastic container The cartridge case was for the faeces and the plastic container was for the urine and when they were full I should tell the guard The room was about two metres times one metre wide   Q Was there a guard in front of your cell;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
in front of the door outside if you wanted for example something to drink or did they come to take the boxes or the ammunition box with them A Ms Lawyer we were guarded constantly When we were thirsty we asked for water Whatever was given we just took it We did not dare to ask for more If we were given half full of glass we Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page just took it or if we were given a full glass we just took it Q Was it your impression that there was a guard outside of the cell or did you have to shout very loud to reach a guard A Ms Lawyer when I was thirsty I would ask Brother I want some water I am thirsty  so the guard would fetch a glass of water and walk to the cell and give it to me After that I drank Even if I could get rid of my thirst or not I would not ask for more   Q Was the cell dark the whole time or did you have light in the cell A Ms Lawyer that cell was constantly dark There was no light because all the windows to that room were all closed So both day and night it was all dark it was all the same Q Could you have  from nowadays;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
on if you look back could you have any orientation about how long you were in the cell or how  yes how long you were in the cell any time orientation A I was in that individual cell for only days and nights After that I was placed in the common room upstairs until Phnom Penh fell Q Now additional questions to the interrogators You have already named them and said they had different shifts I would like to know was always only one person in the interrogation cell or were more than one present during the interrogation A Ms Lawyer there was only one interrogator For example Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Comrade Sieng he interrogated as well as he typed on the typewriter Q In the moment when Hor came in to beat you up as you have told us was he alone in the room or was another interrogator in the room A Ms Lawyer at that time I was with Comrade Sieng who interrogated me When Comrade Hor entered then Comrade Sieng reported to him that I did not confess so after he heard that Comrade Hor rolled up his sleeves he pulled a stick and beat me up One stick was broken then he used another stick And there were actually a bunch  quite a large bunch of sticks next to the table   Q;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
Thank you That was like  I could call it like a control through Hor and then to intervene that you should confess and to beat you up Can I take it like this that Hor controlled if saying already get a complete confession from you A Ms Lawyer I cannot understand the question clearly Can you repeat Thank you Q Yes Am I right that you said that Hor entered the room and that he controlled if you have already given a complete confession and to intervene then A I find it difficult to respond because I did not know whether Hor came to control the confession or not but at that time only Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page after hearing what Sieng told him Hor immediately grabbed a stick and beat me right in front of Sieng and Hor was a wellbuilt person And later on he explained to me and asked me to recognize him as the person named Hor He told me later on I would be easy to be recognized with the scars on my face so please remember it    Q Thank you Was it the only time that Hor entered the room during the days and nights A Yes it was the only time he came in Q My next question concerns the time when you have already left the individual cell and when;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
you started your work in the workshop and I would like to know from this moment when you started the work until the end when you could leave Tuol Sleng if you have been threatened or beaten or insulted by guards or other staff of S A During the time when I was working I was no longer mistreated During the day they would let me work in the workshop outside to the other fence and at night they would take me back and put the cuffs and shackles on me and later on of course I was threatened to be shot Q Thank you Mr Chum Mey I have a last question and this is that I would like to know which question would you like to ask the accused Could you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page please tell the Chamber what is your painful question A The question that I would seek the permission from the President to ask Duch would be about the CIA and its organization So I only have two questions to ask him   BY MR PRESIDENT Q What questions are you going to ask to the accused A My question is when I was accused of being CIA have all the CIA agents been smashed all or are there still any CIA agents remain Number two when you mentioned about Angkar what kind of Angkar;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
was it Because when I went to Tuol Sleng I was asked by students about Angkar and I could not answer to them and they asked me who Pol Pot was and I could not respond to those young students because I myself cannot say that Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge would be the same so I am ambivalent when it comes to who is who here Q Would you want to ask him three questions or two especially when it comes to the last one about who would be Pol Pot A Actually the last question was about the questions the students asked me and that I could not find the answer Thats why I would probably refer it to Duch MR PRESIDENT The accused have you listened to his questions And the first question is that he was accused of being a CIA agent and he went Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page on to say that have all the CIA agents already been gotten rid of THE ACCUSED Mr President and Brother Mey I would like to clarify that the term CIA  I think you have been observing the proceedings long ago and that the CIA is the term used to refer to people who were opposing them So CIA here were not people who received salaries organized by the Americans It was meant to refer to those who opposed;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
the CPK and that we still have some of them   And those who oppose the CPK still remain Thats why they won or have beaten the CPK So the real CIA and the CIA perceived by the CPK are different So CPK for example implicated you as CIA They only identified you who were opposing them Thats why you were presumed as being the CIA agent So the opponents of the CPK have beaten the CPK so I dont think they have been gotten rid of anyway MR PRESIDENT The second question from Mr Chum Mey is seeking your explanation about the term Angkar what would it mean THE ACCUSED Thank you Mr President I would like to tell Brother Chum Mey that Angkar referred to the Standing Committee Among them they even called Pol Pot as Angkar And for example like me I worked at S I called Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Son Sen Angkar because Son Sen represented the Standing Committee and thats all   MR PRESIDENT Is there any further question the lawyer would like to put to the witness Ms Studzinsky MS STUDZINSKY Thank you Mr President From our core group lets say in this case there are no further questions I would give the floor to my colleagues Thank you very much MS JACQUIN Good afternoon Your Honours BY MS JACQUIN Q Good afternoon;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
Mr Chum Mey I would like to ask you the following questions They are related to your period of imprisonment at S   First when you were detained at S did you have the feeling that the guards the interrogators or other staff of S had feelings of fear or even were terrorized A At S for the period of about four months I never looked at them in the face I just looked to the ground when I walked past them And during the times when I was there I was blindfolded and shackled and when I was walking upstairs then Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page they would pull my ears up and down I was so scared that I could not look at them into the face Q When you were detained in S did you ever hear guards or interrogators laughing or having fun amongst themselves or did you only have a feeling that there was an atmosphere of terror prevailing everywhere A At that time when I worked behind the location actually I heard when people laughed when people cried and I dont know whether they laughed for  I mean they had fun having tortured prisoners or not And as Duch already mentioned he did not hear anything and I dont believe his testimony because even I worked far behind the premises I could even hear the;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
screams the cries and when people stopped to break then there would be less noisy Then later on we would hear some further noises Q Thank you My next question When you were detained in the common room along with many other prisoners did you ever see detainees coming back into the room after having been interrogated or after having been tortured A Some could be seen coming back Some had disappeared   Q Next question When you yourself were detained in that common room after having been tortured did you explain even very quietly to your neighbours what had happened to you Did you explain to them how you had been in the individual cell Did you explain to them even in whispers how you were tortured Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page A I did not talk to my neighbours nor explained anything One day I heard the noise of a truck at about p m and I asked my neighbour why the truck came but in whisper But we did not let the guards who were guarding outside know our whispering The guy told me that the truck would come to collect prisoners to be taken away to be smashed at Choeung Ek I had to wait until the moment past p m sic at night that I could sleep because otherwise I would be taken on the truck to;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
be smashed So another day Q Was there a degree of solidarity mutual help cooperation amongst the prisoners A No one could help anyone else Everyone was on his or her own because how could we help one another because we wore shackles and anything could be done upon permission from the guards Even when we moved and then made some noise then we would be beaten if we did not let the guards know about our movement   Q Next question Was there always one guard who was awake and with you in the common room A Guards would be walking back and forth on the corridor and then we would shout to them to bring some water when we were thirsty When we would like to sit up then we would also ask them for permission to do so Q My last question Were you aware that you were all victims or did even you fear that some of the people perhaps who were Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page detained and shackled next to you possibly were traitors A I think everyone who would be shackled there would have been perceived as traitors already though as Duch already mentioned everyone who entered Tuol Sleng would never be released and it is obviously true Q So in fact you yourself as a detainee in Tuol Sleng you were never in a;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
position to be able to trust the other detainees shackled next to you You were never in a position to have any amount of trust in your codetainees A How could we trust them Of course I could whisper into the ear of my neighbour about the truck once but I have never been able to ask them why they were arrested because the guard would be very vigilant and we could be hurt and we could be in trouble Q Thank you Mr Chum Mey MR PRESIDENT Now the time allocated for civil party lawyers has already been used and the Chamber would like to take a minute adjournment We will resume at past p m The court officials could you please take Uncle Chum Mey to have a rest before he could be returned to the courtroom Judges exit courtroom Court recesses from H to H Judges enter courtroom MR PRESIDENT Please be seated The Court is now in session Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Before the adjournment we noticed that the national lawyer was on her feet What would you like to make  what is your comments MS TY SRINNA Thank you Mr President for giving me the opportunity to make comments I raised my hand before the adjournment because I was about to ask for permission from the President to put questions two questions to the witness We;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
knew that our time has already run out but we would like to ask him about the events when he left S My next question links to his statement that he tried to stop people from torturing him So I think these will be the two main questions I would like to ask   MR PRESIDENT The Chamber has already decided and we have indicated clearly that the four groups have minutes minutes each to put questions to the survivor Since the Chamber notes that the opportunity for questions to be put before Chum Mey have been granted by the international lawyers and now that the national lawyer would need to ask only two questions so your request is granted Please the floor is yours MS TY SRINNA Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Thank you Mr President for once again giving me the opportunity to put questions to Uncle Chum Mey BY MS TY SRINNA Q Good afternoon Uncle Chum Mey My questions will be brief and I will make them short We would like to thank you very much for your testimony Question number one is during the time when you left S it was the event when the Vietnamese troops approached  nearly approached S and the situation at that time was chaotic and the guards of S tried to flee S compound   May I ask you before;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
you left the compound did you check or see any rooms whether you saw dead bodies or other prisoners Could you please elaborate further on this A Thank you the lawyer Before I left S for Amleang I did not inspect any room I mean the south building I just left immediately and after I returned I was called to have my photo taken at Tuol Sleng and at that time I saw a bed with the dead body but its only seen through the photo not the real event And I asked Oeng Bech about the photos and he told me that when the Vietnamese came and those prisoners who could not walk were shot by the Khmer Rouge and they died instantly on those beds And having listened to Duch he said that only four prisoners were ultimately killed but I have counted the dead body  I mean the people who have died There were of them Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Q Thank you Why did not you check in the rooms Did you leave hastily or were you forced to leave the compound A When I was leaving I did not check inside the rooms because we were pointed the guns at us and we had to be walking straight forward into a straight line and we could not even dare turn back Q Thank you Uncle My;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
second question is when you were tortured to extract a confession the interrogators who interrogated you did they give you the names or ask you  or dictate the names to be written in the confession or the name have been written by yourself A Im sorry I think I may need you to repeat the question Q I will try to rephrase the question When you were being asked or interrogated in order that you respond with the names of people who were behind your network or people who ordered you to become CIA agent such things like that So were the names given to you to write down in the confession or were the names spontaneously brought up by you yourself A They did not give me with names They only asked me to think about the people my network and how many people of my associates who joined the CIA or KGB I was limited to only confess to the matter of CIA and or KGB not other matters and I was not given much time to respond I had to really respond immediately without delay Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page   And at that time I did not know whether other people implicated me in their confession that led to my arrest because I did not make any mistake that led to my arrest at all So I;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
also wanted to know how many KGB or CIA agents still remain the question that I have already asked to Duch because the question seemed to be thoroughly inflicted on us to get to answer the network of CIA or KGB so that we could survive and this matter makes me want to ask Duch once again how many KGB or CIA agents still remain and when people were accused of being enemies how many enemies are there Have they all been smashed or are they still living So who actually created the mechanism to ask questions or interrogate prisoners to tell them about the CIA and or KGB networks I have hear that people were implicated as CIA or KGB agents although they have committed  or maybe made a mistake by breaking a pen or committed other wrongdoing Then they would be presumed as CIA or KGB Q After having responded and implicated people in the confession have you realized the fates of those people you have implicated A I have not observed whether the people I have implicated in the confession would be arrested because the time for confession was rather short it was a fourmonth period so I did not see them MS TY SRINNA Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Thank you very much Uncle Chum Mey I have no further questions And thank you Mr President  ;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
MR PRESIDENT I would like to give the floor to the defence counsel to put questions to the witness if they would wish to do so MR KAR SAVUTH Thank you Mr President and the Chamber I would like to ask a question to the witness QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL BY MR KAR SAVUTH Q You said that two children went to look for gruel Could you identify whether they were boys or girls A Mr Lawyer they were boys The youngest one was about one year or so the elder brother was about three years old and they would go there to find gruel for eating Q Thank you You said that after you asked questions to the cook who told you that the children belonged to Cheng On and the persons still  one of them still survives among the two My next question was the cook the female cook you called alias Sor phonetic  do you know where she lives now A I dont think I know where she lives I am searching for the information of Comrade Sor phonetic because we had worked Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page together closely near the kitchen and I would like to know where she is also   Q Thank you The third question at the workshop where you were working did you have a hammock A I did not have;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
a hammock Q Thank you The reason I asked that question because some people told us that the two children would sleep on that hammock there The fourth question did you organize or put the instruments in the workshop in order or were they scattered around everywhere A The workshop was not wellorganized It was a mess The pans used for cooking gruel would be left at one place while the machines the sewing machines that I got fixed would be lying disorderly Q Thank you Question number five when the Khmer Rouge soldiers shot your wife dead and your twomonthold son did you notice that your son got killed when your wife was dying A At that time she was carrying the baby and I think that when the mother died they would also kill the baby because it is the nature of the Khmer Rouge   Q Thank you Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page Last question when you were introduced to the reenactment at S and when Duch made the statement to apologize to all the victims I remember that you said you were waiting for this phrase for almost years Do you still recall having said that A Mr Lawyer I do remember having said that Q Thank you for recalling the statement Could you please tell us that you have been waiting for years to hear that words;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
so can you elaborate further on that phrase A I have been waiting for many years to hear the words from Duch who would say that  because at the beginning he said he was an intellectual he was a teacher and he said that he would not be easily moved by the other  the four groups of people and I thought that he realized that and awakened that he had killed people And I thought that he would not any day say such things like that Thats why having heard that I was happy and he shed his tears before me at Tuol Sleng I told him that I would not use a few teardrops to wash away the suffering of the more than two million Cambodian people who perished during the regime So the sheds of tears would not be able to wash away those sufferings Only the Court can help to wash away those suffering MR KAR SAVUTH Thank you Mr President I do not have any more questions   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page MR PRESIDENT Defence counsel the international defence counsel do you have any questions to be put to Uncle Chum Mey If you have the floor is yours MS CANIZARES Thank you Your Honour I have no questions for Mr Chum Mey MR PRESIDENT Judges of the Bench do you have any questions to;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
be put to Uncle Chum Mey JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Yes President I would appreciate locating on the aerial photograph of S precisely where Chum Meys workshop was during the period that he was working there as a mechanic I am wondering if the Prosecutors have the reference to that aerial photograph please MR SMITH Yes Your Honour we have called it up now and we ask that it be switched to our screens JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Is it acceptable President to ask for it to be switched to the Prosecutors screen MR PRESIDENT The A V Unit can you switch the screen to the CoProsecutors screen   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Thank you BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Q Chum Mey you have said that you were working in a workshop as a mechanic and it was near the kitchen or part of the kitchen Can you tell us exactly where that workshop was by looking at this photograph which has been taken from the air First of all do you recognize the buildings the way they are laid out in that photograph A Your Honour all these buildings are the actual reflection of the situation but there was actually a rear gate Now there are a lot of flats Usually at the exit there was a long building with a corrugated metal roof First Comrade Sok put all the food supplies into;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
one side and then there was also a sewing machine at that location And also a pile of a lot of clothes were along that building and next there was a kitchen with those large cooking pans for gruel And after that that was Ta Kongs location Its a wood workshop for building and fixing chairs and tables And next there would be a rabbit raising ground and then pigpens to the south And a little bit to the west there was a big tree and that was the location where dead bodies were carried behind my back to be buried under that big tree   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page And when I worked in my workshop I was facing that big tree and Mr Bech was working nearby as well So they dug the pit under the big tree and they buried the dead bodies I dont know how many dead bodies there but for the incident that I saw I saw three dead bodies They were carried in the corrugated zinc plate Its like a stretcher and those dead bodies were buried under that big tree however now that big tree was gone Q Thank you Is the building that you have described shown on this photograph A Your Honour from what I can see its hard to say anything because at that time that building had no walls;1;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
There was only a roof on that building It was not in the horizontal formation Q When you talk about the rear entrance where this roofline was was that behind Blocks B and C A Its hard for me to recognize the building B or C but if you talk about the east or the west then yes I probably can say it better It was actually behind those two buildings Q If you look at the top right of this photograph where the little circle is highlighting you can see that norths to the right and west to the top of the picture Can you see that A Yes I saw that direction The building was to the west of that building   Q The building you have described as really just being a roof Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page attached to a fence was behind B and C Is that right on the western boundary A Your Honour it was not attached to the fence From that fence there was a large ground and after passing that large ground then there would be the kitchen and my workshop If we went across further to the top that would be the other buildings So that building was not attached to the fence near these two buildings Q But the building was behind B and C to the west of B and;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
C Is that correct A Your Honour yes its clearly that the building was to the west of these two buildings JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Thank you Mr Prosecutor MR SMITH Thank you Your Honour That seems to clarify the matter There is a  when you look on the screen  and this is D   you can see the blue dot and at the bottom of the screen and that shows the photograph from a different angle but sounds like its been clarified   Your Honours in relation to the Vietnamese video which your Honours are still determining the admissibility of that video I believe shows this workshop Shows the pile of clothes and shows the very things that Mr Chum Mey is referring to Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page So either that could be shown now or alternatively I would just ask that that be remembered when looking at that particular video the way hes described it JUDGE CARTWRIGHT Thank you Mr Prosecutor I think the President made it clear yesterday that we have still to determine that issue I have no further questions of this witness Thank you MR PRESIDENT Judge Lavergne Microphone not activated Mr Kaing Guek Eav what has been said by Chum Mey regarding the likely location of the workshop and the kitchen within the S compound it was told the upper part of the photo;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009
it means it was to the west of building B and C and there was a fair distance from those two buildings so there was a large ground in between those two buildings and the workshop Does his description reflect the actual location of the kitchen and the workshop   THE ACCUSED Mr President the description of Brother Mey is correct The workshop building where Brother Mey worked was the former Tuol Sleng high school I went into that building for one time for about two minutes to see how people deal the cases for ammunition storage Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber  Trial Day Case No   ECCC TC KAING GUEK EAV Page And the Prosecutor Tan Senarong also showed me the photo So actually formerly it was a school building and it is true that it was to the west of these two buildings MR PRESIDENT The international CoProsecutor requested  yesterday by Robert Petit regarding the video clip and we deferred the decision on that until an appropriate time when a decision can be made after our discussion So actually on last Friday we discussed the remaining issues and made some decisions on certain issues but that issue and a few other issues are yet to be decided so we defer the matter until further notice And now the hearing of the testimony of Chum Mey the survivor of the S Security Office has come to an end Therefore the Chamber;0;1;Chum Mey;E1_40.1_TR001_20090630_Final_EN_Pub;Case 001;30.06.2009

Im grateful that I could travel from the United States to appear before this Court and to have the opportunity to make my statement of sufferings regarding what we suffered under the Khmer Rouge regime from to late Before the April I was living in Phnom Penh I was a teacher and my husband at the time was the lieutenantcolonel and was the youngest brother of Chumteav Kheng the first wife of the Marshall Lon Nol I had three children the eldest son was Sophanouvong Bay alias Paul and my daughters name was Botum Kunthea Bay alias Pine and my twomonth baby at the time was Lilavodey alias Pomme I was living with my husband and my family And in late my husband was assigned by Lon Nol government to study in Fort Benning in Columbus Georgia for the senior official military role and I was living with my three children in Phnom Penh at the time   Q And can you tell the Court what happened to you on April A On the April Khmer Rouge soldiers entered Phnom Penh They were walking everywhere along the streets they were dressing in black uniform and every one of them male and female were armed They had stern facial expression and those Khmer Rouge soldiers began firing shots into the air and chase the Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC people to immediately leave their houses and;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
Phnom Penh I was terrified I could not imagine that they would do that I carried my youngest child and together with my two other children I could not manage to carry any much belonging So I only got clothes for each of my child and some milk and milk bottles and I placed them all in a carry bag that I used to use it for going to school   And I had to leave urgently as we were repeatedly chased and warned by the Khmer Rouge soldiers And they said that the Americans would drop the bomb very soon and that we would only leave for three days I had to leave if not and if the Khmer Rouge soldiers enter my house I would be killed or  I could not imagine what would happen because I had photos of my husband in the military uniform displayed in the house as well as the photos of my related family members of Marshall Lon Nol So together with my three children and a bag filled with clothes I went to my other sisterinlaws house whose husband was the wifes minister of the general mobilization named Van Sarin But the Khmer Rouge stopped me from proceeding forward For that reason I had to leave where I was pointed to I did not know where I should head to everybody was confused So I just kept going along with the rest along the side streets reaching the main streets;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
And the road was fully crowded each step took a long time to move forward And I was on the main road near Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Chamkar Mon and we were heading in the directions instructed by the Khmer Rouge so we reached Kbal Thnal and then Chbar Ampov   And along the road as I observed on the day the scene was pitiful I saw dead bodies the bodies of the Lon Nol soldiers the bodies of elder people the body of children and pregnant women And another scene that I witnessed was that of the disabled people and those people who still had oxygen in their nostril And if you can recall that was the hot season the hot month in Cambodia and we had to travel under the heat of the sun We kept moving very slowly under the heat of the sun together with my three children I held on very tight to my children as I was afraid I might lose them So we walked crossing Kbal Thnal crossing through Chbar Ampov and then we were heading toward Traeuy Sla The journey took us several days before we could leave Phnom Penh We had to stop and rested at empty houses belongs to Chinese families and we would just stay at any empty houses as the rest of the travellers did   So we just kept going;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
and one time we reached an area where there were a lot of mango trees It was raining that day and I had nothing to protect my children so we took refuge under a mango tree We were all soaked I had my young baby close to my chest and I covered the baby with my body and in the morning we were chased to go further by the Khmer Rouge soldiers And from that Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC day my young baby  that is my daughter became sick That was because of the impact of being soaked under the rain and because of the extreme heat She got fever and my two other children also got fever and myself I also got fever But we had to force ourselves to move as instructed by the Khmer Rouge and we did not know  we did not have any destination in mind Later on we reached Traeuy Sla and my childrens situation became worse so I decided to stay in that Traeuy Sla village We went to take refuge under the house of the Base People Those Base People had pity on us because they saw I had young children so they gave us some food   But the Khmer Rouge soldiers reprimanded the Base People and instructed them to stop giving food to us And we were chased to move to stay;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
far away from the Base People because of my distinct social class as I was treated as the New Person the April Person and the villagers were considered the Base People So the Khmer Rouge soldiers chased me away  chased us away to the end of the  to the outskirt of the village and  tried to build our shed by ourselves My youngest baby was becoming even seriously sick But because the Khmer Rouge soldiers threatened us I had to go into the forest and to pick the palm tree leaves with my two elder children and they were still pretty small at the time and then I borrowed a knife and cut some tree branches and then I  thats the ground and erect those palm tree leaves Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC as our shelter But I could not stay there for long as my daughter became seriously sick With me I had a diamond ring which was a gift from my elder sisterinlaw when I got married so I exchanged that diamond ring for some medicine with the Base People   Initially I exchanged for cans of rice and then I exchanged the rice with aspirin I got tablets of aspirin and other medicine for the treatment of my children and myself But the medicine could not improve the condition of my children especially my young daughter She got;0;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
dysentery she could not eat anything as she would throw up when she ate anything So I went around looking for anyone who had the medical experience to help my children One villager then advised me to walk about four or five kilometres from the village and that I would find a military hospital So I went along by carrying my daughter and with the other two children I saw a male soldier and I was told that he was the medic I begged that military medic asking him to save my children I told him that my children got fever and dysentery and would not take anything The medic asked me to bring along my children and there were a few beds and I was asked to put my young baby on the bed Then he came back with some kind of medicine and he injected my baby on the skin on top of the skull I did not dare ask what it was Upon the time he took away the needle my youngest child got seizures and passed Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC away I cried That was the first time that I witnessed such a tragedy in my life I packed my baby and we all cried   In the afternoon I carried the dead body of my youngest daughter to bury in the forest nearby I carried the dead body to;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the forest nearby and then I buried her myself There were only two people help me dig the pit and I put the dead body in the pit And I put a wooden post on the grave so that I could recognize it later on At that time I was very confused I was in a state of confusion I could not do anything I became very forgetful And since then the Khmer Rouge soldiers made me to work extremely hard from morning till night I had to plant corn My two other kids stay at home nobody took care of them they stayed at home alone and I had to go to the corn field to work And upon my return at home I did not see my two kids I was very very shocked I had to try to look for my kids And then a few minutes later they came back home I was happy They carried with them two small branch of trees and then my younger sister told me that she used this small branch of tree to dig something  to look for something for it   And they told me every day about what they had to do and I was very shocked upon hearing what they had to do during the daytime so I decided to leave the place I decided  I attempted to leave the place twice but I could not do it because I was eventually Page E;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

a way   And here is my third question If you were not aware of it if you did not order for such conduct by the Khmer Rouge who actually did it Who actually gave the order And I would like the response from you as the leaders of the regime at the time Thank you MR PRESIDENT In principle your questions have to be put through the President And as Mr Khieu Samphan is present in this courtroom I will now redirect the questions to Mr Khieu Samphan first and then Mr Nuon Chea Khieu Samphan you may proceed   MR KHIEU SAMPHAN Good morning Mr President Good morning Your Honours and good morning everyone in and around the courtroom and my national compatriots who are present here today and good morning Madam Bay Sophany I would like to respond to your questions First of all I would like to inform you that I am not the leader of the Democratic Kampuchea regime Although I was labelled as the Head of State I did not have any authority And to respond to your question whether I was aware that children Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC were killed by the Khmer Rouge soldiers  and allow me to apologize I did not know anything at all and that is the truth I did not know anything at all regarding this matter   And;0;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
to respond to your second question that why children were mistreated and interrogated and were those Khmer Rouge soldiers given instructions to do so To respond to this second question I would say I did not know about this matter To my knowledge there was no such order not at all And to respond to your last question  but before that allow me to add to your second question  I personally did not give any order to any soldiers to do so I did not have any authority over the military not even a smallest group of soldiers And personally I am not that crude and illiterate person like that   And for your third question that you asked whether if I did not know who knew about that You said you went to Traeuy Sla this means that the person who was responsible for that sector was the one who had the authority to do so this is my understanding So I myself would oppose such cruel and crazy act but I really regret that I did not know about this matter and that is all Thank you Mr President MR PRESIDENT Thank you The questions by the civil party are now redirected to Nuon Chea Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC And Nuon Chea you may respond to the questions Mr Nuon Chea can you hear us If so can you respond;0;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

morning to you Madam Civil Party We unfortunately have very little time at our disposal and yet your story is extremely rich in detail and quite lengthy Therefore I will ask only a few supplementary questions and do my best to avoid reviving your personal pain and agony Q In a letter addressed to Mr Al Santoli you stated that you lost many members from your side of the family  from your husbands side of the family and that they had departed in order to be executed I wish to know how you learned of that occurrence how you learned of those events And if you know whether or not they were identified as members of Mr Lon Nols extended family   MS BAY SOPHANY A I received the information from the villagers who were from the native village of my motherinlaw When the Khmer Rouge chased people away from their houses my inlaw families all went toward their native village  that is in Run village in Takeo province So they knew of the backgrounds of my inlaw families very well that my fatherinlaw was the fatherinlaw of Marshall Lon Nol They knew about the occupation of my elder Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC brotherinlaw as well Q And were several members  were several of your inlaws members of Lon Nols army or did several of your inlaws serve as officials for;0;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the Lon Nol regime A The relatives of my husbands side were mainly public servants and they were senior government officials For that reason the burden was placed on the Lon Nol extended families Even on my side my parents who were living in Kampong Chhnang were killed because they were the inlaw of the Marshall Lon Nols fatherinlaw and the Khmer Rouge knew about that   Q Thank you Youve also told this Court that many of your husbands friends who also served as public servants or soldiers for the Lon Nol regime had perished under the Khmer Rouge regime Based on your observation were those public servants specifically sought out and targeted by the Khmer Rouge during the to era A I am not sure about the chasing and the killing but I knew for sure that the Khmer Rouge people killed Lon Nol soldiers in particular the military officers who were in a rank similar to that of my husband And there were only a few surviving military officials who are currently living in the United States and a few are living here in Cambodia   Q I wish to return to the topic of the treatment that was meted Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC out to the April People when they were sent to forced labour You stated that when villagers were providing your children some food out of the;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
generosity of their hearts the Khmer Rouge had prohibited them from doing so Did the Khmer Rouge ever describe or provide reasons as to why there was different treatment based on different categories of people And did they ever explain why April People were segregated from the Base People A That is true The Khmer Rouge told me clearly that my social class was different from that of the Base People in the village I was told that I was considered the New People the April People while the villagers were considered Base People and I should be separated from the Base People Q And were the Base People and April People treated in the same manner regardless of the village that they lived in in terms of housing health care they were given food they were given treatment or even in the manner in which they disappeared   A Yes there was a huge difference The Base People who were considered to live in a liberated zone they had more than what we had they had sufficient rice to eat We the April People only ate watery gruel with a few grains of rice and we only had salt to eat And sometimes we were given very little dry fish or fermented fish but mainly we only ate with salt And sometimes we were starved As in the case of the death of my son we were not given sufficient food and my son died And what we;0;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
had at Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC that time was only rice bran and tree leaves in the pot How could we survive with rice bran The rice brand was meant for pigs to eat But we had to resort to eating rice bran and tree leaves Q In the same documents that I referenced to earlier D you stated Madam Civil Party on ERN French page ERN in English and in Khmer you state the following I for one stayed there in order to break stones and I was treated as a prisoner of war The word prisoner of war was used by the Khmer Rouge regarding the April People  Why is this so Madam A We were treated as the New People the April People We had a different social class compared to the Base People While we were working we were watched by armed people Even during the night time when we were sleeping people would be walking around and monitoring us We were forced to break rock and to achieve three tauv of rocks per day for road construction I was wounded in my leg and I was forced to break a big rock And at the time Mr President and Your Honours I did not have any medicine for the treatment of my leg The wound became worse and infected and I could not walk but I had to move;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
myself to go and break rock otherwise my ration would be withdrawn so I had to work while I was sick And the only thing that I could use for the treatment of my wound was to pick the tobacco remains that was thrown away by the Khmer Rouge and I used it for the Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC treatment of my wound   Q Thank you Unfortunately I do not have enough time to delve further into that matter However I do have two remaining questions or subjects that you raised in the same document concerning a woman who was severely beaten and punished by the Khmer Rouge because one of her children had denounced that she stole a pumpkin And you stated that the woman was the wife of the unit chief and it was explained that she was not beaten as an individual but she was being beaten on behalf of the regime on behalf of Angkar as a way of retaliating against imperialism  capitalist Were you able to sense the sense of mistrust and defiance that the leaders felt against people such as yourself members of the bourgeois class A That is true A woman whose husband was a former soldier and who was breaking rock next to me was  that while the mother was breaking rock the children who were left behind in the village were beaten;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
up and interrogated They were asked whether  or what the parents were doing during the former regime and whether they stole anything from Angkar   When I returned from breaking rock I saw at the back of my children  they actually used a charcoal chalk to draw or write something on the back of my children And I noticed they did that Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC almost every day because when I returned from work my children waved and they told me that they were beaten and asked about the occupation of the father and the mother and whether I stole anything And I told my two children whatever they were asked Dont ever say that your father was a military officer and lived in the United States And you have to remember that otherwise if you tell them then you will be killed and so would I I will be killed as well  So although my children were beaten up by the Khmer Rouge every day  as they were asked about my husband and I  my children maintained that they did not know anything And I told them that they should say that my husband was a teacher and that we were separated and thats all they should reply to the Khmer Rouge And they remembered the phrase and they always replied the same thing and for that;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
reason I survived here today   But for that woman who was breaking rock nearby me the children of the woman were asked and they were scared and then they told the Khmer Rouge soldiers that One day my mother hid a pumpkin  So the Khmer Rouge soldiers went around looking for a pumpkin and they couldnt find it So they used a piece of wood each and began beating that woman They tied her hands to the back and asked her to stand on her knees she was beaten up and she protested that she did not steal anything But they kept beating and beating and they even kicked her in the chest The woman  Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC the Khmer Rouge female who was pregnant also kicked her chest and scolded her that she was an imperialist and she was a capitalist and they kept beating her So the mother was beaten up in front of me at the rock quarry and we  the ones who were breaking rock at the time  were told by the Khmer Rouge that the woman was beaten up because she was the enemy and she stole stuff and eat We could not do anything we kept our head down and we were encouraged to beat that woman Even if I had to die I would not lay my hand on her This;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

I was told that it was meant for fertilizer And I told the Khmer Rouge that I did not have any fertilizer to put in the pit and I was by myself and I was sent to the front by the Khmer Rouge But they kept asking me to dig a pit It was metres by metre and metre deep But I did not complete it because the Vietnamese troop arrived   MR DE WILDE DESTMAEL Thank you very much Madam Civil Party for having answered my questions I have no further questions to put to you Thank you Mr President MR PRESIDENT The floor is now given to Nuon Cheas team to put questions to this civil party You may proceed Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Do you have any issue to raise MS SARKARATI Your Honour as Ms Bay has flown all the way from the United States and she has very valuable information on the impact of her suffering we ask for just five more minutes for the civil parties to pose the questions on suffering to her Judges deliberate   MR PRESIDENT You are granted with the time to put the question to the civil party You have five minutes QUESTIONING BY MS SARKARATI RESUMES Thank you very much Your Honour Q Ms Bay I just have three more questions for you You described to us that you have symptoms;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

chase you to go away from your house but it did so to your neighbours is that correct A They were about to come to my house because they were approaching from my neighbouring houses and they would come to my house soon For that reason I decided to leave my house immediately That was the case that they chase everybody to leave the house Q As you said they did not chase you and your family but they did so to your neighbours But it was your understanding that it was unavoidable that they would chase you from your house is Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC this correct A The Khmer Rouge chased people from every house and they were about to come to my house For that reason I had to leave my house because I was very sure that they would come to my house soon   Q Allow me to clarify this point When they were about to approach you and your house how far were they and how many houses were in between A Microphone not activated MR PRESIDENT Madam Civil Party please pause a bit until you see the red light on the microphone MS BAY SOPHANY A It was just one house down then it will be my house For that reason I was very shocked I did not gather much belonging and had to leave with my;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
children BY MR SON ARUN Thank you Q Does this mean you left Phnom Penh on your own free will and not by the Khmer Rouge is this correct   MS BAY SOPHANY A I did not leave my house on my own free will Who would do that Its because of the act by the Khmer Rouge soldiers They Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC fired shots into the air and they chased people to go away from their house and insisted the Americans would drop bomb And that was the statement that scared everyone So although they did not come to my house yet  and of course I would be afraid for them to come to my house and see the photos of my husband and families  I had to leave If they were to enter my house and saw the photos and while I was there then there would be big trouble for me Q Yes I understand your point Allow me to move forward When the Khmer Rouge were one house down from your house did you observe that they were threatening your neighbours or they were in an ordinary normal character or behaviour   MR PRESIDENT Civil Party please wait The assigned counsel for civil party you may proceed MS SARKARATI Thank you Your Honour This line of questioning is repetitive and at this point I believe the;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
defence counsel is badgering our witness MR SON ARUN Allow me to respond I am a defence counsel and we havent yet questioned or completed the questions of this civil party and that is the right of the defence counsel to only focus on one particular matter or to put it in a segmented based on our Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC approach And if of course the civil party cannot respond that would be at the discretion of the Bench   MR PRESIDENT The objection raised by the assigned counsel for civil party is not sustained The Civil Party you are instructed to respond to the question put to you by the defence counsel It seems that the civil party cannot recall the last question put to her Defence Counsel please repeat your last question BY MR SON ARUN In order to save time as we only have minutes I move on Q When you saw the Khmer Rouge approaching your house what did you observe Were they in  were they behaving in a cruel manner or was their behaviour normal And what were they wearing At that time what was the environment like   MS BAY SOPHANY A They were of stern facial expressions they stared at us they threatened everyone to leave the house They fired shots into the air and they shouted for everyone to leave the house otherwise;1;1;Bay Sophany;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

then we would be returning to our homes So we left our house and we were looking for my parents because when  before they left they told me that if I looked for them along the river bank I would find them But then I tried to look for them anywhere but I could not find them I only saw dead bodies along the street I just went on and on aimlessly   They told us that we would go to a place where Angkar designated for us and they told us that Angkar had plentiful food for us to eat we would have sufficient things to eat Unlike Lon Nol regime we had to pay for everything Over there we did not have to pay anything but we had a lot of things to eat Then I was looking for my parents I told people along the ways and then they told me that my parents were sent back to welcome Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Samdech Sihanouk I wanted to return back home but I was not allowed to do so They told me that I must not return home or I would be killed So they told me that those who were supposedly sent to welcome Samdech Sihanouk was meant to die So eventually they put me in the work site On the early days they distributed some food for us;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
rice two cans of rice for us But once we got fully into the work site they no longer gave us rice Instead we had to eat communally we were given only a few ladles of watery gruel for us to eat   At that time it was a prison without wall we had to work very hard They forced us to work extremely hard And as for our food ration the watery gruel was purely water and if they saw us  some vegetable inside our gruel then they would beat us If you only got one mango they would beat us with the whip of the weapon They discriminated against us saying that we were from the feudalist family we were from the city we were from  we were the city people we were capitalists so they discriminated against us They said that it serve us well when we came to the countryside enduring starvation Thats what they mocked at us And in addition I was from Kampuchea Krom but I had resided in Cambodia for a long time so I did not carry the accent of Kampuchea Krom people And my parents were of course from Kampuchea Krom they still had strong accent of Kampuchea Krom so they always accused me of being a Kampuchea Krom At that Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC time they rounded people from Kampuchea Krom and;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
then they were all executed   They rounded them up in different location and then they told me that those people who had been rounded up were taken to do the plantation or farming somewhere else But in reality those people were all killed they accused them of being Vietnamese But in reality they were not because they had resided in Cambodia for a long time during the Sangkum Reastr Niyum time But they carry certain surnames which follow the Vietnamese tradition and then they accused them of being Vietnamese And when they were talking and chatting with each other sometimes they expressed themselves in Vietnamese then they were accused of being Vietnamese For example if they had some action which was the tradition of Vietnamese then they would be accused of being Vietnamese Upon hearing any Vietnamese sound accent those people would be considered Vietnamese and they would be destined for smashing They said that the Kampuchea Krom People were the agent of the Vietnamese they were the agent of the CIA During the Khmer Republic there were soldiers supported by the Kampuchea Krom people and my uncles were from Kampuchea Krom They were soldiers of the Khmer Republic And some of  other uncles worked for the late Son Sann And other relatives of mine from Rumlech Boeung Khnar and other places also worked for the Republic Khmer Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

that time I did not imagine that these things would happen Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC and I saw dead bodies along the street I did not know who these people were and they told us  actually they encouraged us to move forward saying that we would reach a place where we had plenty of things to eat over there Then I thought that probably I would reach that place Before we left Phnom Penh they also told us the same thing They told us that unlike the Lon Nol regimes we had to pay for food We had for example riels per bowl of noodles Then over there we would pay only riels per bowl of noodle So we would have a lot of things to eat over there   Q Concerning your evacuation you said you did not meet with your parents What was your feeling like at that time when you did not meet your parents You actually tried to meet with them You did not know the fate of your parents at that time What was your feeling like at the time A I was completely despaired at that time I was around or years old I did not have that  I was actually terrified when I saw the dead bodies along the way And when I got to the worksite I realized that the situation would be different;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
It was not as what they told me because we had to work very hard And there was segregation among people in the worksite too those who were considered the April People had to work very hard and had nothing to eat   Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Q When you were marching out of Phnom Penh along the way until you reached Sang Kaoh Thum when you were on the move were your biographies taken by the Khmer Rouge A Well at that time I had my biography written There was a man from the former Ministry of Veteran Affairs He saw me carrying water for him He whispered to me that I must not reveal my true biography for example I must not tell them that my parents were the former officials of the previous regime or my life would be in danger I should only tell them that Your parents were farmers If you ever told them that your parents were officials you would be killed So thats what he whispered to me So I told them that I was the son of farmers I was minding cattle and then B dropped and killed all the animals so I had to come with them So they asked me to stay in one side   Q Well I would like to interrupt you I need to move to a more specific point;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
You told the Court earlier that at that time in your village or in your cooperative people were segregated They were named April People or New People or Khmer Krom People So can you enlighten the Court when the Khmer Rouge learned that certain groups of people were Khmer Krom or the April People what was their living condition like and what was the overall Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC treatment of these people like A When they took the biography of the people they actually could recognize the actions of people from Kampuchea Krom So upon knowing that they were from Kampuchea Krom then they would classify them or group them in one particular group And then they would assign them for a certain work And we thought to ourselves that we would be in a problem We did not know our fate actually On that day I wanted to join with that team as well but some people told me that I must not join that group And then the next day later that group of people were evacuated  were executed rather   Q You told the Court that you lost your parents and relatives Do you happen to know when they all disappeared and what actually happened to them do you know that A At that time I think that there was some sort of purges They tried to segregate between;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the April People the April People and Kampuchea Krom People So there was a clear segregation There was no mix of Cambodian people The April People cannot stay with the April People So there was a clear segregation in the group of people I think that that was the approach that they mobilized in order to clearly divide the people I was there At that time there was a sense of hatred against those with Vietnamese action Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC   Q You knew that your parents and relatives died Do you know when they died and why they died A When I was on the way actually to Sang Preaek Touch I was told by people that my parents had already returned to Phnom Penh to welcome Samdech Sihanouk Before I left the city not only my parents left but other families also left So when we were there people told me that my parents and relatives had already returned to Phnom Penh Those people were considered educated people so they had to return to Phnom Penh to welcome Samdech Sihanouk so that he would reorganize the structure in the government because he was the former official And then they disappeared and they told us that they were all killed but I did not know where they were executed   Q I know that youre holding photos in your hands What;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

Mr Khieu Samphan My first question is Why were the Khmer Krom people rounded up purged and then smashed and why were they accused of Cambodian  them of being Cambodian with Vietnamese heart My second question Did  were you involved in the policy making that led to the killing and suffering of Cambodian people during that regime The third question If you happened to return to lead this regime again would you do it differently Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC   MR PRESIDENT Thank you Mr Sovandy Now I refer your three questions to the CoAccused and I have to refer your question to Mr Khieu Samphan first to respond to your questions and followed by Mr Nuon Chea Counsel  International Counsel for Mr Nuon Chea you may proceed MR KOPPE Thank you Thank you Mr President Good morning Your Honours Although I dont object to questions raised by the civil parties I do note and I would like to observe that the first question is far outside of the scope of the  of the present trial Im not sure if questions of scope of the trial are questions which the Defence can raise but I do note that the persecution of the Kampuchea Krom is not part of this trial   MR PRESIDENT National Counsel for Mr Khieu Samphan you may proceed MR KONG SAM ONN Thank you Mr;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
President In addition to my esteemed colleague for Mr Nuon Chea I would like to touch on question number that the civil party is asking questions that elicit assumptions or speculation so I believe that this question is not appropriate Therefore I submit that Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC the Chamber reject the last question posed by the civil party   MR PRESIDENT Thank you And the Counsel for Mr Nuon Chea do you have similar observation or do you share the observation of the defence team for Mr Khieu Samphan concerning the third question posed by the civil party MR KOPPE Mr President I see the hypothetical nature and the  and the speculation character of that question I think my client will also be able to see that We limit our objections to the first question MR PRESIDENT Counsel for the civil party you may proceed   MR SAM SOKONG Mr President concerning the first question posed by the civil party concerning the rounding up or the purges for execution or the accusation of the Cambodian body with the Vietnamese heart I believe that this is utterly within the scope of the hearing and I believe that he is the civil party and it is an opportunity for him to state his suffering and it also the times that he should put the question to the Accused This is what he has;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
always wanted to do Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC And as for the third question I dont think that the third question elicit any speculation I think that this question is appropriate in the sense that if he would lead this regime again whether or not he would choose to do it differently Thank you Judges deliberate   MR PRESIDENT The Chamber rules on the objection by the defence team On the first question the Chamber wishes to advise that according to the direction in relation to the hearing of the suffering and harms sustained by the civil party the Chamber grants the opportunity for the civil party to state the suffering and harms he or she sustained during the Democratic Kampuchea period from the of April to the of January For this reason the question is considered appropriate The Chamber  the civil party has put the question to the CoAccused and the CoAccused are directed to respond to the question As for the third question this question concerns directly and indirectly to the suffering of the civil party and this opportunity is considered to be the opportunity that the civil party can put the question to the Accused Therefore it depends on the Accused themselves whether they would choose to respond to the question Therefore I refer the question to Mr Khieu Samphan first to Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC respond to the question put by the civil party followed by Mr Nuon Chea You may proceed   MR KHIEU SAMPHAN Mr Soeun Sovandy I am pleased to respond to your three questions Your first question Why did the Khmer Rouge segregate the Kampuchea Krom people and then eventually take them for execution To the best of my knowledge that was not the case To the best of my knowledge at that time the leaders of the Khmer Rouge had the plan to mobilize the forces the national forces including Kampuchea Krom people too in order to defend our country from being aggressed by Vietnam There was no policy there was no suggestion whatsoever to segregate the people As for your second question whether or not I was remorseful that I created a policy that led to the indescribable  indescribable suffering of the Cambodian people I would like to respond to you as follow I have never taken part in forming such a policy because in my life never have I imagined that I would form any policy to kill anyone especially Cambodian people   As for your third question  if I can return to that period what sic would I behave  my  your last question is rather difficult to answer for one fact is that we cannot return to the Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC past When we get old we are old we cannot return But lets say if we can rewind the clock and return to the past what would I choose to do If I could rewind the clock and go back to the past I would demand that the sufferings that Cambodian people had endured be known to the leaders and to others and I would demand categorically that the Communist Party of Kampuchea redirect its direction to its original plan when it was incepted During its inception the Communist Party Kampuchea set a direction that Cambodia had to be independent peace and prosperity people enjoyed their life and people have happiness and our plan was to ensure the surplus of agricultural production so that we could export in exchange for some necessary commodities such as medicines and other stuff   At that time Cambodian people were lack of medicines So the lifenecessity commodities were very important medicines and other important stuff in  for everyday life That was the first priority And then after that we would bring in factories and manufacturing and production so that Cambodia would gradually become industrialized That was the original plan and direction of the Party Thats what I had known but what you had described that I did not know I can tell you frankly that I did not know the atrocity committed and the pains people sustained Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

them of being Cambodian body with Vietnamese heart This is the first respond to your question Number As I said in my first point to my knowledge the second question relates to the first question And as for the third question it has been around years already since then Now if we could go back to the past what would be the policy of the Democratic Kampuchea I would say that it varied depend on the situation of the country As the leaders we had to find policy to prosper the country so there was  there is no possibility of returning to the past but it varied depending on the situation Thank you   MR PRESIDENT Thank you Mr Sovandy The time is now appropriate for lunch adjournment The Chamber will adjourn now and resume at this afternoon And this afternoon the Chamber will hear your statement of sufferings and harm and another civil party this afternoon And Court Officer please assist the civil party during the break and have him returned to this courtroom before Security guards are instructed to bring Mr Khieu Samphan to the holding cell downstairs and have him returned in this courtroom before this afternoon The Court is now adjourned Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Court recesses from H to H MR PRESIDENT Please be seated The Court is now back in session The floor is now given to;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

and they both in the same unit  that is Division They were of the Kampuchea Krom origin led by Son Ngoc Thanh Q When you boarded a boat in Kampong Cham at Tonle Bet was your uncle on the boat as well   A He was probably on the boat as he was a military officer and his subordinates and him shall be there on the boat as there was a war at Tonle Bet in Kampong Cham And after they reach an agreement then they boarded the boat for the journey to Kampuchea Krom and there were probably hundreds of them on the boat However the boat was shelled and sank All died Q When that boat was shelled at Tonle Bet in Kampong Cham were the Lon Nol soldiers on the boat or were there several of them or just civilians on the boat A I did not witness it with my own eyes as I was in Phnom Penh but it was likely the case Q When you were evacuated from Phnom Penh by the Khmer Rouge soldiers did  could the people refuse to leave A People could not refuse to leave as the soldiers were armed and if someone refused to leave that person would be shot dead at Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC the house and it happened at the nearby houses near my house some houses had;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the rocket launchers fired into and by witnessing that I decided to leave   So I packed some rice and I went along with the other people If I were to leave I would probably die They were cruel and mean Q When people were being  being evacuated and while they were on the road did the Khmer Rouge actually have their people to monitor or to track down people while they were travelling en route and did they threaten the people while they were travelling A During the evacuation we were actually forced to move quickly as Americans would drop bombs from their B planes and that Phnom Penh would be smashed to pieces by a nuclear bomb and they were forced  and we were forced to move  to go and following Angkar instruction that we would meet with Angkar but we did not know who Angkar was We could not spend the money that we had and along the road we tried to barter for things We exchanged the clothing that we had or the gold that we had for food   Q When people were evacuated from Phnom Penh by the Khmer Rouge did the Khmer Rouge give instruction to the people or did they assist the pregnant women the children the disabled people or those who could not walk for instance the elderly Did they Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
ECCCTC have any measures  such measures during the evacuation A During the evacuation initially there were some people who had the medical knowledge would assist each other but when we were at the Angkar places there was no medicine given and what we were given were only those rabbit drop pellets and they use coconut juice as IV fluid Q When you reach your last destination in Sang district and during your living there did you witness any strategy that happened to the people in the Sang district and did you meet any of the Khmer Rouge leadership in Sang district and if so what did they tell you A At the place where I lived I did not meet any of them as I went to work outside and I came only back into the village to get my gruel ration   And if people were requested to go and work in the farm sometimes it meant that they would not survive that they would be killed And some people were actually guarded to dig their own pits and later on they were killed I refer to those Kampuchea Krom people And they were walked in lines line by line and it happened around or p m so that not many people could observe that Q Thank you Mr Soeun Sovandy As the time is limited I will only ask you two more questions Can you tell the Court why you had to flee from;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
Cambodia and went Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC to Vietnam in late A As I thought that one day it would be my turn to be killed because at that time the Bophea people were being killed every day So we thought that we would not be spared and we were only waiting for the day to be killed and for that reason we decided to swim across the river to seek help from the Vietnamese side   And yes upon arriving in Vietnam some Vietnamese fishermen actually assisted us and they were actually spies for the Vietnamese and then they sent bigger boats to rescue us And then we told them that the Pol Pot group killed a lot of people and that the Khmer people killed the Khmer people and for that reason we would seek refuge in their land And at that time they could also witness how skinny we was and we were actually shocked to see their country to see everything was kind of normal with the market but when we looked back it was despair and hopelessness We did not have any freedom to do anything We could not even walk across from one side of the street to the other We were only  we were confined to only travel between where we stay and where we worked It was a prison without walls   Q You;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

it was so pitiful for the situation in Cambodia and for the people who were forced to work and they knew only nothing but working and there was no market nothing at all and that was extremely opposite of the initial liberation as after the liberation we applauded We were so happy we thought that peace would arrived but it was the opposite Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC It seems that we were imprisoned imprisoned in a prison without walls We were deprived of rice and were given only watery gruel And we would not even allowed to supplement the watery gruel with tree leaves I actually picked a mango and I almost lost my life for that I was accused that I betrayed the collective that I picked that mango without requesting or informing the Angkar and I was blamed by this young soldier who actually drag their  his rifle The situation was indescribable   MR CHAN DARARASMEY Thank you Mr Soeun Sovandy On behalf of the Prosecution I thank you very much for answering the questions and I hope that your responses would contribute to ascertaining the truth and I wish you all the very best Thank you Mr Sovandy And thank you Mr President I have no further questions for this civil party MR PRESIDENT The floor is now given to Nuon Cheas defence to put questions to this civil party;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

in English and in Khmer and in  and the ERN is as follows in English its and in Khmer it is Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC and it continues on the following page   My question for purposes of clarification is raised because when you read the first form you understand that the entire family left on the same day I also noticed that in the supplemental information form which you appear to have rectified or corrected and it is the following document in French and in Khmer it is and in English In this supplementary document this is what you state in French When the Khmer Rouge arrived in I was living with my sister in Phnom Penh  The problem I have with this information and which is why I need your clarifications is that in the first form for which I gave the reference number you described the facts as follows In any case this is what we find on the form You stated that you had been separated from your family you and your sister along the road   So my question to you is this When were you separated from your family was that on the road or you were separated quite simply because your parents had left before the th of April A They actually had left one week earlier thats why we were separated And when;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
I left with my elder sister and when we reached the Angkar place then she was separated from me as she was moved to a mobile unit and I moved to another mobile unit Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Q So in specific terms my question to you is as follows If your parents left one week before the th of April why did they leave Were they forced to leave A They were forced to leave At that time they were told that they  they should leave for a short period of time until they prepared Phnom Penh and then they would be allowed to return in a month or so and for that reason my parents asked me to stay behind at the house But later on everybody was asked to leave Otherwise we would be killed by the bomb dropping by the American planes   Q Very well but one week before the th of April the Khmer Rouge had not yet arrived in Phnom Penh so my question to you is this Who forced your parents to leave their home at that time since you state that that was one week before you were evacuated One week before you were evacuated your parents left Who forced them to leave at that time A Here I talked about the events that took place after the liberation of Phnom Penh I did;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
not talk about the date prior to arrival of the Khmer Rouge After Phnom Penh got liberated people were chased to leave Phnom Penh I talk about the day that they were chased from Phnom Penh and the point that they had left earlier because we were told that we would be  we would have to go only temporarily and that we will be allowed to come back but I cannot recall for sure the Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC date that we left   I could only recall that at that time the Khmer Rouge were everywhere in Phnom Penh Some of them could not even drive a motorbike They wanted to ride  to drive it but they fell down They did not even know how to use a pen but they tried to put a pen in their upper pocket And I saw goats and materials being transported busily in Phnom Penh at the time Here I refer to the period that  that they had already entered the Phnom Penh and the people were chased to leave Phnom Penh I cannot recall the specific date Q Theres a matter that I do not fully understand Pardon me Youre saying that you dont recall the exact date and yet this morning all of the questions that were put to you were based on the premise of things happening as of April;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
th Am I to understand that you nor your sister left Phnom Penh on April th or  but afterwards is that what I am to conclude   A I describe it based on the event that unfolded on the liberation day on the of April when people were evacuated out of Phnom Penh And when they evacuated Phnom Penh they told us that we would leave for a short period of time We would leave for two or three days and then we would return to Phnom Penh because they need to organize the city So people left in stages some people left earlier and other left later And Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC then they threatened the people with the American bombardment in the city so we had to leave Q Yes Mr Civil Party I understood that quite clearly However my issue lies with the date on which you left and your parents left You stated that your parents departed one week prior to your departure so either they left before  they left seven days before April th because you had left on April th   Do you understand my question because when you say that you left on the same date as your parents or not it would be two different occasions but my question is if you stayed at your residence after  after April th after liberation;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
did you stay for one week after the liberation of Phnom Penh at your home A Yes that is correct as I stated in my testimony earlier I think that I have made myself clear with that I do not recall the exact date because it has been so many years since then At that time I was years of age and now I am or already I have forgotten some of the events There were a lot of issues a lot of events at that time and I had to move here and there I could not remember every detail And I have separated with my relatives I had to leave from one place to another in search of my relatives I went to various refugee camps but I could not find any of my relatives there Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC   And I was  I was from a soldier family from the Lon Nol regime I wanted to be soldier myself and I was  I wanted to be in paramilitary official and I wanted to find out why we as family had to separate I was looking for my relatives but I could find none of them and even overseas I did not find that they were living or residing in any countries Q In the interests of absolutely clarity and this is my final question in an attempt;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
for clarity are you stating that you remained at your family residence after the Khmer Rouge soldiers that you described this morning had ordered you to leave the City of Phnom Penh Did you stay in spite of the order That is my question A Yes that is correct They forced us to leave our home but I stayed on and then it was until they threaten us and I heard gunfire as well and I then had to leave MR PRESIDENT Lead CoLawyer for the civil party is there any issue You may proceed   MR PICH ANG Thank you Mr President I think that the question and answers are not consistent According to my listening to the French channel during  at the question was whether or not he was with his family after the Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC of April the week after that but in Khmer is  it seems that he was  he and his family was in Phnom Penh or not so I think it is not clear In order to make it clear for everyone I think that we need to clarify this because I believe that his statement does not respond to the question by Counsel so I would like to suggest that Counsel put the question again for the claritys sake Thank you Mr President BY MS GUISSÃ‰ Im not entirely sure what was;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
said in Khmer However what I did say it was perhaps not properly conveyed so yes lets try and achieve clarity   Q Mr Civil Party today at this hearing you have stated that your parents and your younger siblings left your family residence one week before you sir left Phnom Penh before you left your house Is this correct and have I understood accurately Did your parents leave Phnom Penh one week before you did MR SOEUN SOVANDY A Yes that is correct Q And did they leave on the day that the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh the day of the liberation of Phnom Penh A Yes that is correct Q Therefore since you left one week after your parents would it be accurate to say that you left one week after the liberation Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC of Phnom Penh   A Yes because they told us that we would leave the city for a period of time until they organized  reorganized the city then we would come back So I and my younger sister had to stay back to look after our house hoping that our parents would return home after they have reorganized the city but in reality they never returned so it was not in my  it was not only my families but the other families in the city as well had to leave At;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
that time they had no choice Otherwise they would  their life would be in  in real danger so they had to leave And nobody dare protest those who dare protest they would confront the gunshoot sic instantly Q From the time of liberation and from the time your parents left your family home and from the time that you yourself left your family home with your sister if I understand correctly you had stayed the entire at your home You never left or exited at any point in time is that correct   A Yes I had to leave I had to leave my house Otherwise I would be gunned down over there They warn us that if I resist leaving I would be killed in Phnom Penh because Americans would bombard the city soon so we had no choice but leave the city We had to And then after that we heard gun fires from every direction of the city I did not know what was going on so Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC everyone had to leave the house And as for my parents before they left they told me that if I left the house I should look for them somewhere along the river  riverbank but I followed them anyway but I could not find them When I was being evacuated I was only told by others that my;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
parent had already returned to Phnom Penh to welcome Prince  the prince at that time but I did not know where they were killed Q Im not sure if this was a matter of interpretation but that wasnt my question I wanted to know from the time that your parents left on the day of liberation and from the time that you sir left which based on your statement was one week after liberation did you  had you been staying at your house the entire time or did you ever leave   A Yes I was evacuated out of my house and then I had to look for them along the river MR PRESIDENT That is the question Mr Sovandy I clarify the question for you Your parents left you a week earlier and during that period you stay in your family residence It was only one week after your parents departure did you leave your house so the question for you is that from the time when your parent left your house until the day when you departed your house did you ever go out anywhere outside of your house or not Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC MR SOEUN SOVANDY A After my parents departure I simply walked around my neighbourhood I saw people carrying their belongings and other stuff out of Phnom Penh and I was rather afraid at that time;0;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
so I prepared my stuff as well and then I went out looking for my parents   BY MS GUISSÃ‰ Q Mr Civil Party I wish to know whether the scenes that youve described of Khmer Rouge soldiers firing gunshots happened on the day that your parents left Phnom Penh on the same day as the liberation of Phnom Penh or if they occurred seven days after April th Did you witness that scene on the day of your parents departure or on the day of your own departure MR SOEUN SOVANDY A I witnessed that scene I witnessed the Khmer Rouge soldiers threaten the people They shoot their guns into the air to deter people to leave the city and I then decided to leave my house to look for my parents I had to look for them along the riverbank Q One final attempt before I conclude Mr President On the day that you left one week after your parents departure on that same day were there other people among Phnom Penh residents who were in the midst of leaving Phnom Penh or were you and your sister the only people to leave Phnom Penh on that day   Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC A I saw  I saw many other people walking or marching out of the city I saw people walking along the street in  in lines At;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
that time we were evacuated along National Road Number to Chbar Ampov and it was very crowded along the road And people started to leaving the city Some were walking their bicycles other were on their motorbike It was very crowded indeed on that day along the road Q And to be crystal clear the scene that you describe happened on the day that you departed with your sister is this correct A Yes they left altogether They had to leave they had no choice They were forcibly moved out of the city And I  when I was leaving the city I saw people walking along the street It was very crowded I think I have answered this question Of course some people left earlier and others left later because people told  they told us that we would leave the city for a period of time so people started to leave some left earlier and others left later That was the situation at the time MS GUISSÃ‰ Mr President on that I hereby conclude my questioning of the civil party I wish to thank him for having attempted to answer my questions Thank you   MR PRESIDENT Thank you Thank you Mr Soeun Sovandy The hearing of your statement of Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC suffering and harm has come to an end now and your presence before the Chamber is no longer;1;1;Seoun Sovandy;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

first question to you concerns your sight You are unable to see You are blind And you have stated in your civil party application that you lost your sight because of the Khmer Rouge Can you please tell this Chamber how that happened   MS SENG SIVUTHA A The reason my eyes went blind was that during the three years eight month and day period I was forced to collect pigs excrement in a deep pit and I had to carry more than baskets for each turn I became exhausted with sufficient  with insufficient food to eat and I had to climb out of the pit carrying the pig excrement I fainted and then I fell down And the person who was carrying the pig excrement behind me actually stepped on me and I was hit with a shoulder carry pole They later tied me up to a tree and they beat me up I cried They Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC kept beating and then they hit my left eye Later on they collected the fertilizer stored in a warehouse I cried I tried to collect my own share and put it into the warehouse I could not do anything that late evening so I went for my porridge ration   Actually my left eye was very painful at the time and the tear dropped at night and in the morning I;1;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
could not go to work because of the pain in my  in my eye so I went to meet with my grandfather and the rest of the family were not in I saw him on the stack of hay and asking him to  and asked him to look at my eye And he asked me what happened why it became so red and he was told that I was beaten with a rope And he told me to warm it with a soaked scarf but I could not  he could not have me follow as he has to work with the hay And then he asked me to carry the cow dung back to my mobile unit At that time I was pretty young I was around years old when that happened and I would not know what would happen to my eye later on I thought it could be treated but there was no medical treatment and whenever I wash my face it was so painful I struggled to work with the extreme pain on my left eye   And later on I decided to go and meet my mother but my mother was not there So I carried the pain in my eye with me and on the liberation day in I learned that my left eye was completely Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC damaged as at the time I;1;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
met or I reunited with my parents and they noticed that my left eye was smaller than the right eye My mother looked at it and she knew that there was a small spot on the iris and that she said she would purchase medicine from Vietnam and then use it on my eye but it didnt get any better so it became worse each day And I actually attended school in I was in class but my tear from my left eye kept flowing And at that time even on my righthand side things became a blur I could not read the letters on the blackboard clearly And people made a joke out of me at the time They asked me  I have a oneeye girl I was ashamed of that so I decided to quit school and came to sell small stuff with my grandmother And in I got married and by that time my left eye was completely gone and my right eye became worse The tear kept flowing and I could not see things properly   Let me go back a little bit In fact in my grandmother took me to the Chinese hospital Pet Chin here and I was told that my left eye could not be recovered So there was no hope in recovering my left eye and unfortunately my right eye became worse and the treatment  despite the treatment it did not get any better And as I said earlier;0;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

When you were asked to leave Phnom Penh through the evacuation what kinds of orders were given to you by the Khmer Rouge soldiers And could you refuse the orders or the orders were absolute that you had to leave A I was pretty young and I did not know about the event clearly What I recall was that in the morning the soldiers arrived and I did not even know they were the Khmer Rouge soldiers I only knew they were the liberation soldiers and they came to liberate the people from Phnom Penh and that people from Phnom Penh should leave  people who came to liberate Phnom Penh told the people there to leave it temporarily that they would have to clean up the capitalist groups first and after they cleansed the city then people will be allowed to return   Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Q When you were evacuated from Phnom Penh and on route did the Khmer Rouge monitor or track down the people who were being evacuated from their departure until they reached the destination A I could not observe that clearly as I was young but I heard the announcement on the mobile loudspeaker on the vehicle that people were asked to return to where they were and not  and to just keep moving in the direction that people were heading and not to travel in;0;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the opposite direction So we kept walking along with other people and we would rest where we could together with other people but we would not be allowed to stop for long as we only had to stop for cooking food and after that we had to eat quickly and continue our journey Q Did you hear or can you still recall that the Khmer Rouge used the words Angkar feudalism capitalism imperialism or the April People And if you can recall it or if you heard it did you know what those terms mean A I did not know about for example the Issarak soldiers I only knew that during the regime I heard the words capitalism capitalist reactionary the April People etc and the April People were considered the capitalist I myself was scolded as a April Person and as a feudalist   Q Can you tell the Court why you were sent to Sector in Takeo province Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC A I did not know back then but people who were living in Phnom Penh if we were travelling along National Road Number then we will be started to go toward Takeo and that is to Sector And other people travelling different national roads will be taken to different sectors So while we reached Tonle Bati we were forced to the board the GMC truck and we were taken to;0;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013
the countryside Q In your document you stated that you were also sent to Sector You were sent and worked there What was the difference between Sector and A In fact there was no difference between the two sectors The situation and the conditions were the same that is hard labour and insufficient food We were treated the same so I believe it came out from one same policy   Q You said that you lost your grandmother and grandfather Can you tell the Court the reasons for the loss of their lives A I lost my parents and a large number of my family and relatives I did not know whether they were taken and killed or they starved to death but before the liberation of Phnom Penh we usually visited one another or we went to the theatre together but upon the April we were separated And at the end of the regime my grandmother and I were waiting for our relatives to arrive at our native village but we did not see any other family members coming to the native village Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC Q Due to the time limit I have two more questions for you In the area where you lived were you treated as human being Were you given your freedom to live   A Referring to the freedom to live as a human being that;1;1;Seng Sivutha;E1_200.1_TR002_20130604_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-1;04.06.2013

Q Very well You knew that it was not the Central Market after the liberation by the Hun Sen soldiers But that means when you filled out the form in you already knew that you hadnt been to the Central Market but to Chbar Ampov Is that not the case A I meant to say Chbar Ampov market or Phsar Chbar Ampov Q Right But since you already had been informed of that by the Hun Sen soldiers why did you still talk about a central market when filling out that first form MR PRESIDENT Civil Party please hold on And Civil Party Lawyer you have the floor Please turn on the microphone Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among the three language versions of the transcript The corrections are based on the audio recordings in the source language and may differ from verbatim interpretation in the relay and target languages Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC December   MS TY SRINNA Mr President I object to this question because the civil party did not say it was Hun Sen soldiers who told him about Phsar Chbar Ampov So if this line of questions is allowed to continue its going to get the civil party out of line of what he previously testified Thank you BY MS GUISSE I believe it;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016
may be an interpretation problem because that is what I heard in French Q Mr Civil Party can you tell us who informed you that it was Phsar Chbar Ampov and not the Central Market and when were you informed of that   TCCP  A When you asked me a question previously I could not grasp fully I did not mean that I was told by Hun Sen soldiers What I meant is that I was told after the Hun Sen soldiers liberated us I was told by people but not by Hun Sen soldiers And in fact it was people that is after the liberation in whom I met and I spoke to them They said about the evacuation from Svay Rieng and I asked whether we were instructed to rest at Phsar Thmei or Phsar Chbar Ampov And those people who were evacuated when I was said that we were evacuated Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among the three language versions of the transcript The corrections are based on the audio recordings in the source language and may differ from verbatim interpretation in the relay and target languages Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC December and stayed at Phsar Chbar Ampov At the time people were evacuated from three provinces Prey Veng Svay Rieng and Kampong Cham Since the;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016
central market or Phsar Thmei was already full some of the evacuees were allowed to rest  at Phsar Chbar Ampov or Chbar Ampov market   Q Very well My question remains the same therefore Since after the liberation by the Hun Sen troops you had received that information why therefore in do you still talk of the Central Market A I apologize Maybe I did not pay much attention to that And it is probably my mixup Q In the passage I quoted you talk of your visit and your stay  but you did not talk of the presence of Khieu Samphan Can you explain why A Because when I spoke maybe I did not say everything and probably I only spoke in response to the questions that were asked Q But since you made mention of the distribution of food scarves and clothes and the fact that you were transported in trucks to subsequently go to the railway station and you give details on that day about what they gave you In your statement before the Chamber you appear to make a link between the distribution of food and supplies with Khieu Samphans arrival Even though you may not have been asked specific Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among the three language versions of the transcript The corrections are based on the audio recordings in the source language and may differ from;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016

the nd of August So I maintain my question Q Mr Civil Party insofar as you remember did you mention the name Khieu Samphan to this person during this first interview and does this name not appear in the document in spite of what you recounted because the person that was in charge of drafting the document forgot it Do you remember having mentioned this incident TCCP  A Mr President to my recollection when I was interviewed no such questions were put to me about my meeting with Khieu Samphan It was later on that I was asked about my meeting with him It was after that time I told the information about the meeting and I myself did not know if the meeting with him was included in my application   Q Very well then What you want to say and I want to be sure that I understand this correctly since you were not asked questions about Khieu Samphan when you talked about what happened at the market  whether it was at Chbar Ampov or the Central Market  you didnt spontaneously mention Khieu Samphan but you mentioned the fact that you had received rice scarves clothing That you mentioned And you talked about your transfer to the train station when you were asked about it because a priori that is Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among the three language versions;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016

necessarily have seemed important for a legally nontrained witness or civil party Just a general remark   BY MS GUISSE I do not know whether after the pleadings by the various parties we are already in closing arguments on this subject but I think that as counsel for Khieu Samphan I have good reason to ask these types of questions to ask why it was only some time in that the civil party voiced inculpatory testimony against my client whereas he had been interviewed by various persons since It appears to be normal to me When the civil party lawyer says that I am putting words in the witness mouth that is not the case It is not me who put words in the witnesses mouth  it is the witness himself who said that he did not deem it necessary to provide this information It is normal that I should try to obtain information before making my own interpretations I am putting questions to him to Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among the three language versions of the transcript The corrections are based on the audio recordings in the source language and may differ from verbatim interpretation in the relay and target languages Page E Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia Trial Chamber â€“ Trial Day Case No   ECCCTC December inquire as towards his state of mind and ask why he;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016
did not talk about this earlier and  it is normal to put questions on this matter So I think that in that sense these are only remarks are not objections So I can proceed   Q So to be very specific my question is as follows At this time you talked about Khieu Samphan in that Supplementary Information Form even though specific questions were not put to you on what he said you did not consider it important to talk about all of the events that occurred at the market all of what you saw and all of what you heard from Khieu Samphan during that distribution TCCP  A Frankly speaking at that time I did not pay much attention to that And only later when I was called by the Court staff I could recall the event Previously I did not think of that As simple people we do not pay much attention to that The main focus of us the farmers were to increase high yield in the field and not to pay much attention to that And that is the reason I did not respond or speak about that nor was I asked by the organization staff on this issue   Q I would like us to now talk of the last Supplementary Information Form that you submitted as part of the investigations Corrected transcript Text occurring between less than  and greater than  signs has been corrected to ensure consistency among;0;1;2-TCCP-1063;E1_505.1_TR002_20161201_Final_EN_Pub;Case 002-2;01.12.2016

wrong was that the questioning from the Defence had to do in general with the arming of the Muslims I do not believe the questioning specifically limited whether they were receiving automatic weapons or whether they were receiving larger type weapons Perhaps I have misunderstood the crossexamination but that is my understanding of it Therefore I also wanted to  THE PRESIDING JUDGE The question that you objected to Mr Wladimiroff was whether or not the witness had seen heavy vehicles and artillery Is that not your objection MR WLADIMIROFF That is right your Honour THE PRESIDING JUDGE The basis of it is that it goes beyond the crossexamination von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm MR WLADIMIROFF Exactly Hollis THE PRESIDING JUDGE Now in response to that what do you say Miss MISS HOLLIS Your Honour I am simply saying my understanding of the way the Defence worded their crossexamination had to do in general with arming of Muslims and to the extent that implied larger weapons than Page handheld weapons I would like to cover that If they were speaking only of arming the Muslims with handheld weapons then I will not cover the artillery MR WLADIMIROFF I did not deal with that subject I dealt with the identification of uniforms and equipment and I dealt with knowledge about weapons with Muslims I did not deal with any weapons that were with Muslims with Serbs whatsoever and I did not deal with the giving of weapons to;0;2;Isak Gasi;960515IT;IT-94-1-T;15.05.1996

What I am interested in then is the matter of the flower pots on the pista that were pointed out to you in a photograph earlier this morning Do you recollect that A Yes Q Perhaps if we could have on our screen then these particular containers as shown in I believe it is Exhibit MISS HOLLIS I believe that is MR KAY If that could be put on the video monitor so that we can all see it Thank you Perhaps it can be adjusted so that we can take the light off the righthand side which we have at the moment and perhaps any reflection be shown on the lefthand side Thank you very much Mr Bos To the witness You recollect being shown this Page photograph earlier today Mr Mrkalj A Yes I remember Q What I am interested in is your opinion that there would have been greater spaces between these containers at the time that you were on the pista A Yes A I do A Yes A It is Q Do you recollect giving that opinion earlier today Q We have available to us just so that you know photographs showing the whole of this area with those containers and this is not the only photograph that shows them Do you understand Q These containers mark the boundary between the administration building and the large hangar building on both sides is that right Q The spacing that we have within this photograph before the;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
Court is what I suggest to you is the regular and ordinary spacing of the containers on the pista Do you disagree with that A I stick to my earlier statement Q Perhaps if you could repeat that so that I am sure as to what you are saying von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm A Why not There was larger bigger spacing I am quite convinced of that Q So what you are saying is that extra containers have been put in Page position on the pista and the grouping of the containers put in such a way to give a less space  A That is what you are saying Q  between the containers I am trying to find out what you are saying and what the logic of what you are saying whether it exists I am sorry to have to ask you about this but it is my job to test A Just go ahead ask your questions I will reply to them Q You would be saying that there is a greater spacing between those your evidence containers A Yes Q If we have photographs of these containers showing regular spacing of them between the buildings photographs that were taken after August it would seem that you would be saying that extra containers have been added and that those containers have all been adjusted and moved to give a representation such as we see in this photograph THE PRESIDING JUDGE Has it;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

Mr Drljaca Nada Balaban and they filmed this at the beginning of August A I am just repeating what I said earlier There was greater spacing than the one shown in this photograph What happened later I do not know nor can I confirm because I did not see that What I see now there was greater spacing earlier and that is what I claim Q You are not prepared to consider that you could be mistaken or wrong about this behind my words A I am still of the same view it was greater spacing and I stand Q Very well I want now to turn to events that you have described as Page taking place on th June What I would like you to tell me is how you were aware of that particular date Counsel for the Prosecution gave it to you and you agreed but I want to know whether you know and how you know of that particular date A I do not take advice from anybody Let me first reply to that question I speak on my own behalf I came here without advisers without instructions and I am talking about what I have personally seen and experienced So please ask a concrete question what you are interested in I have no advisers nor do I need any THE PRESIDING JUDGE Mr Mrkalj this is crossexamination and Mr Kay is testing your testimony He is entitled to put these questions to you It is;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

remain with you during your confinement in A No it did not It was seized Q Did you have any particular reason to look at the date on your wristwatch on that particular day A Yes it is my part of my professional deformation defect to look at the watch It was part of my service when I was on duty My work was always connected with time limits and in every situation I had to look at my watch and write down the time and the date Q Perhaps you could then help me with what time it was that this incident took place in the administration building A Yes about oclock Q Is that in the afternoon A Yes in the afternoon Q When you went up to the administration building with this younger von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm person were you given the reason for your going there by a guard or A We were standing as I said in a line One of the guards came up to us and pointed at me and said You and you come upstairs to carry a Page someone else body out  Q When you went into the building you had your head bowed as you have told us looking at the ground which was the way that you had to move around the camp is that right A Yes I had my head bowed I did say that Q When you got to the landing;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
at the top of the stairs in the administration building again that was how your head would have been positioned A Yes we had to hold that position until the next order Q So when you got to the landing at the top of the stairs did you wait facing against the wall that we have seen in the photograph A No we did not face the wall The wall was behind our backs Q So you were facing out into the landing but your head was bowed A No I did not face the landing As I stood I was not facing the staircase because the staircase was on my left We were practically in the corridor of the first floor of the administration building Under normal conditions we would be facing the door which I pointed out where Rade Knezevic was standing Q When you arrived at the corridor at the top of the stairs did you just stop to wait for the next order Did you expect someone to then tell you at some stage to do something A Yes we expected something but there was laughter as I said previously Page Q It was then after that laughter that you experienced the young person next to you receiving a blow A Yes Q You could not tell who had delivered that blow because you were looking down to the ground A I think that the blow was delivered by Dusko Tadic von  IT httpswww icty;1;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

a baton apparently did not know what your job was because you told us that he A It is a good question because the question was asked for reasons of Q Yet in this conversation with the man in the corridor you have not asked what your occupation was cynicism his grin his smile referred to him using your name A I said what his name was von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm Q You have given his name in this courtroom but from your evidence earlier today I do not think we heard  A I did not understand the earlier question I am sorry It was not translated to me that way question THE PRESIDING JUDGE What earlier question Mr Kay had not finished a THE WITNESS The earlier question when I was asked if I had said my name MR KAY In the evidence that you gave earlier today you did not tell us that you had used your name or he had used your name when speaking to you in the corridor Page A We must go back to the earlier question This was not translated to me that way I did not say  THE PRESIDING JUDGE We are having a difficulty understanding each other Mr Kay is crossexamining you and what he is saying is that Mr Tadic never used your name before You have to just answer the question that he asks without I would suggest trying to understand why he;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
is asking this I think I understand why you are asking it and that seems to be the problem The question is had Mr Tadic used your name before when he was referring to you Had he THE WITNESS Yes that is  no my name was not mentioned THE PRESIDING JUDGE So then he says to you What do you do  then of course you have testified that the reason you feel that he said that was cynicism but keep in mind this is crossexamination Answer the questions if you understand them THE WITNESS No problem THE PRESIDING JUDGE OK THE WITNESS I would appreciate it if the translators would not take turns so frequently MR KAY I will go back a bit your Honour THE PRESIDING JUDGE I think I understand your point MR KAY Yes THE PRESIDING JUDGE But you may rephrase and reask if you wish MR KAY I do not want to disorientate the witness from the question To the witness During there incident in the corridor the von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm man you say was Dusko Tadic did not use your name Edin Mrkalj Page Q When you looked at that man did you in fact think that he looked A No I did not think so It was Dusko Tadic and at that moment I A No he did not use my name older than Dusko Tadic looked recognised Dusko Tadic Q When you had described him from;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

interested in appearance and description I will ask you this again Was the appearance of the person different not their character but the way the person looked A No it was Dusko Tadic Q Perhaps you would like to look at a statement that you have made in von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm relation to these proceedings and I will give it to you in your own language as well as have to hand the original in English In view of the time your Honour it might be better if we put these matters together and deal with them after the short adjournment THE PRESIDING JUDGE I was going to suggest perhaps you could move to another area and come back to the statements but if you want to follow that that is acceptable Yesterday Mr Wladimiroff had offered for identification purposes a copy of a statement I believe that he said that that was his only copy He offered both the statement in the witnesss language as well as the English translation I merely want to say that if you wish you may withdraw your copy and have a copy made In other words the Registrar will either provide you with a copy or if necessary give you back the copy he gave and we will then substitute for our purposes a copy The same with two these exhibits if it is your your only copy we will be happy to see to it that you;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

ensure that what you had said was within that statement would I be right A Yes but in my  I read it in my mother tongue this statement Q Yes and it was read out to you in your mother tongue The whole purpose of this is that there is an interpreter who does that for you who has a duty and signs it You are not saying that the interpreter has been making things up are you A Could you repeat the question please in your statement are you A I think that some changes occurred Q You are not saying that someone has been making things up to put them Q Because it is difficult to see why someone from the Prosecution would want to insert in your statement as a Prosecution witness that the person they are accusing had changed in appearance do you understand A I do Q When we look at that second paragraph you read out From before my von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm time in the camp Tadic looked as he was between to years old When he beat me in the camp he looked older and you have described him as being years old There seems to be a great difference in ages between the two men A I meant at that time at that time when I knew him as a sportsman I gave that estimate However in the camp at Omarska I mean this referred to;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
the situation to my very difficult mental condition He looked his shape his face appeared older He seemed to me tired Page He looked sweaty As for the height I mean to my mind he was at that time three metres tall not one metre because I was in a completely different mental state That is what I meant Q So did the condition and your mental state in fact make it difficult for you to recognise and identify the man who was attacking you at all A No that is not what I mean I am talking about the situation in which I was that is my mental state when I looked at him and I do remember the statement When I looked at him from the floor upward I mean he looked terrible older completely different but while I was still conscious and could look as I am looking at you now face to face then I could I had enough time to recognise Dusko Tadic So this here refers to my bad mental condition to those difficult moments Q Why did you not want to explain to us before we broke for lunch about those changes in the man who attacked you Why did you not want to tell us about that Why did I have to put this statement to you A Because you did not ask me about my mental state at that particular moment If Dusko Tadic at that time appeared different and if;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

get you quite Q When you saw Dusko Tadic that day in Omarska is it this type of physical condition that you were talking about as being different Page well A Yes Q Sir the Defence counsel asked you if you were saying to the Court that the interpreter had been making things up in that statement Are you saying that there was a mistake in the interpretation A I think there was a mistake in interpretation and it referred to a different kind of situation that is not the state when I came when I arrived the first meeting This referred when I was giving this statement I was referring to when I was on the ground I looked at him upward and that was the appearance von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm Q You understand that it is very important in proceedings such as these that you give the truth as you remember it regardless of what that truth is do you not A Yes of course Q You have testified to these Judges in this courtroom that you recognised the man that day in Omarska as the Dusko Tadic who had been introduced to you by Emir Karabasic Were you able in fact to recognise that man that day in Omarska as the Dusko Tadic who had been previously introduced to you A Yes that was Dusko Tadic and nobody else Q You indicated during the crossexamination that you had previously seen Dusko Tadic prior;0;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
to this incident in Omarska with a long beard Can you tell the Court what you mean When you had seen him before this incident in Omarska had there been a long beard or a full beard This is becoming somewhat confusing and if you could clarify that Describe the beard he had before you saw him in Omarska Page A Yes the longest beard he ever had was roughly like this Q How many centimetres from his face A Oh I would say about two or three two to three centimetres Q So you are talking about a full beard but not necessarily a long beard would that be correct A No not long Q When you testified under direct examination I believe you said that during this incident as the man with the baton raised your face so that you could see him that when you saw him he asked you something to the effect How come you are here What brought you here  is A He asked me yes How come that you came here  and What are you Q If you recall what was the expression on his face at the time he that correct doing here  asked you that A He was very cynical I felt cynicism in that question as if it is you know a man knows why you are here and how you got there but he tries to psychologically kill you and then he asks you a question;1;2;Edin Mrkalj;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

had given us previously she had indicated that at that time when she saw him he had a beard It would be my intention to ask her if she recalled giving that statement if she recalled saying in that statement that he had a beard and then to ask her which is correct whether he was clean shaven or had a beard THE PRESIDING JUDGE Mr Kay MR KAY Yes The issue here is an interesting one as I know jurisdictions vary in their approach to this matter What the Prosecution would be seeking to do is crossexamine their own witness on the previous statement Miss Hollis was good enough to raise this matter with me during the short adjournment and provided me with a copy of the statement this time My submission to the Court is that this is really a province for crossexamination by me if I choose it and seeking to impeach her own witness in this fashion is not Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm something that we would support THE PRESIDING JUDGE Miss Hollis MISS HOLLIS Yes your Honour I believe that as Defence counsel noted this issue is decided differently in different jurisdictions I know for some years many years ago in my jurisdiction and in the federal jurisdiction I believe in the United States you could not do that It has been sometime now that we are allowed to do that to ask them about prior statements that are inconsistent;0;2;Hasiba Harambasic;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
with their testimony I am certainly not treating her as a hostile witness but I would agree that in the sense of the word that we normally talk about impeaching a witness in a sense I would be doing that by asking her these questions I would suggest in the light of the other conversations we have had in this courtroom about approaches taken to evidence that would be an appropriate thing to do I know however as I say there are different approaches taken so I wanted to raise it with the Defence and give them the opportunity to object THE PRESIDING JUDGE As far as Mr Kay your suggestion that this is a matter for crossexamination and for you to decide whether you want to raise it or not on crossexamination I suppose as a tactical matter the party offering the witness at least should be given the opportunity to decide how they want to approach it In other words it is Miss Holliss problem and to say it may not be a problem because of how you might handle it on crossexamination really I do not think solves the problem The real problem is whether or not in our Tribunal the witness under certain circumstances should be subject Page to either impeachment or however you want to call it crossexamination in the face of this There are many approaches Let me confer with my Judges and see Perhaps the witness can be asked if she recalls making;0;2;Hasiba Harambasic;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
a statement and then whether or not this statement refreshes her memory MR KAY Yes THE PRESIDING JUDGE But you are right it would be an impeachment of the witness because there is no indication that her memory needs refreshing at this point von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm MR KAY If I could just raise one matter your Honour I do not think that this is a witness that would have reached hostility and shown animus as against the Prosecution in relation to her evidence MISS HOLLIS We agree with that THE PRESIDING JUDGE As far as I am concerned this little bit whether it was a beard and whether she said at one point that he had a beard and now she is saying no that he was clean shaven perhaps in the scheme of things it is not going to be tremendously important but then I do not know because I do not know where you are and where you are coming So let us see a moment The learned Judges conferred THE PRESIDING JUDGE We have determined that we will allow Miss Hollis to question the witness  I do not want to use the word impeach nor do I want to use the word crossexamination  but bring to the attention of the witness the fact that she had given this statement prior to her testimony today and in the statement she then said that Page he had a beard Is that right;0;2;Hasiba Harambasic;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996
or is it the other way around  MISS HOLLIS Yes your Honour THE PRESIDING JUDGE  had a beard So that you will be able to do that That being done again we will consider the fact that Miss Hollis has had to do this as affecting the weight that should be given to the testimony In other words if she says on direct he was clean shaven and now with the benefit of the statement the witness says that she at the time saw him with a beard then the question in our mind is what weight should we give to her testimony regarding the condition of Mr Tadics face whether it was clean shaven or a beard MR KAY I am grateful for the Courts indication on that matter THE PRESIDING JUDGE Very good Would you ask the witness then to come forward MISS HOLLIS Thank you your Honour HASIBA HARAMBASIC recalled THE PRESIDING JUDGE Miss Hollis you may resume MISS HOLLIS Thank you your Honour To the witness Maam if I could return to a matter we were discussing just prior to the break von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasestadictransen IT htm Prior to the break you had testified that when you saw Dusko Tadic in June in the marketplace in Prijedor at that time he was clean shaven Do you recall giving a statement to representatives of the Tribunal A Yes A Yes A Yes Q In that statement do you recall discussing the time;0;2;Hasiba Harambasic;960718IT;IT-94-1-T;18.07.1996

have  I think the sentence from the beginning is not quite correct I think you do not understand what the sentence in itself von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm means JUDGE MAY What does the sentence mean THE WITNESS Interpretation Im referring to the OSCE mission leaving Kosova on March the th when the signal was given for the mission to leave And immediately after the departure of the OSCE mission Serbian police military paramilitary and civilian Serb forces assaulted the village of Rreshtan where after shelling  continued shelling started against Studencan Peqan e Vogel Doberdolan and others This is the truth MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Could you please just answer my questions because the other side Page and you together with them have opted for you not to testify but only to give a written statement You are just supposed to answer my questions And the sentence that you say that Ive misquoted  JUDGE MAY Mr Milosevic its not a matter for the witness how he testifies Its a matter for the Court So its not fair to put that to him But Mr Zogaj you can help us with this What is being  what is being put to you is this sentence as it was read out This is in the English which Im reading from Youve described what happened in the town when the observers withdrew You left Suva Reka and were walking along the main road and you saw this;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
convoy of Serb army and police which has been mentioned You say I knew then that something terrible would happen  It says There was a Serb police checkpoint at Rreshtan  And then it goes on The other areas were controlled by the KLA  Now thats the sentence youre being asked about and perhaps you can tell us what it means THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes Naturally the KLA occupied its own positions and it was formed to protect the people of Kosova whereas Serbian forces which the accused is  and I hope the Tribunal find him guilty on that  JUDGE MAY No Please dont comment Just give us your evidence Tell us what happened THE WITNESS Interpretation Immediately after the departure of the OSCE mission and I saw them  when I left myself I saw the Suhareke von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page city emptied of Albanians Albanians were afraid of venturing into the streets where only Serbian police with civilian  on civilian vehicles with no registration plates were Some shops were open but there was nobody buying there Nobody ventured out to go and buy JUDGE MAY Mr Zogaj we can read this We have your statement Time is limited You are being asked about the areas controlled by the KLA Now is it right as you say in your statement that the other areas were controlled by them Is that right THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes The regions as I;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

that you speak of were controlled by the KLA that attacks began that is to say a conflict between the army and the KLA Is that right or is that not right A Conflicts were always caused by the Serbian army police and paramilitary And Ive nothing to add to this Q All right I assume that that is your assertion but it is obvious that the conflict was between the Serb forces as you call them and the KLA And then you move on to the next sentence which says and I am quoting it quite precisely The population began to move out en masse towards quieter places  That is to say refugees were leaving the area en masse the area where fighting was taking place between the state forces and the terrorist organisation of the KLA von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Is that the picture that youve been explaining A These were not state forces and these others were not terrorist forces but defence forces and I have nothing to add JUDGE MAY You left out Mr Milosevic the sentence before The sentence before was About p m the first attacks began on the villages of Peqan Studencan and Doberdolan The population began to Page move out en masse towards quieter places  Who was responsible for the attacks THE WITNESS Interpretation Paramilitary forces Serbian police and military forces too were responsible for the attacks And the people left the areas were scared of;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
a possible massacre as it happened in other places as you know And I have with me photographs of the Serbian police and army showing what they did in Kosova Ive got it here with THE ACCUSED Interpretation I did not understand this JUDGE MAY Just one moment so we can follow the position There were these attacks Was there any defence or did the people THE WITNESS Interpretation The defence was conducted by the me just leave KLA JUDGE MAY And whats being put to you is that the people fled because there was a conflict Do you understand Thats the suggestion Now is that right or not THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes Yes JUDGE MAY The people were afraid because there was fighting going on and therefore they left is that right THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes JUDGE MAY Yes MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q All right Weve clarified that Now we can even skip some questions in order to save time It is obvious refugees are leaving the Page area of conflict like anywhere else You say towards the end of the first page A large number of people went to Bellanice and Banje because there had been no shooting or shelling at Bellanice The heavy artillery von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm reached into the KLAcontrolled area and they also used military aircraft not only against KLA positions but also against the civilian population  Did you see that A Yes I saw it First of all;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

you JUDGE KWON Mr Zogaj why did you add the phrase not as a KLA journalist What did you mean by this phrase THE WITNESS Interpretation Ive put it there simply to show that weve been unable to go into areas controlled by the Serbian police and the army but only in those areas that were controlled by the KLA MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Thats a very good answer Now you mentioned Rilindja When did you actually work for Rilindja In what period From what date to what date Approximately Page A Yes I do remember that exactly From June the th to the present to this very day And I will probably die before I leave Rilindja Q Is  was Rilindja published regularly throughout the time that von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm you worked for it Did it come out on a regular basis A Not on Sundays There were occasions when you yourself stopped its publication You were the one who stopped the publication of Rilindja many times Q My question was whether Rilindja was published regularly throughout the time How many times did it not come out for any reason A I cannot say how many times because its people in the administration who should know these things Q But youre a journalist working regularly Now do you say that Rilindja was banned on several occasions Is that what youre saying that some of the issues were banned A You banned it Q;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
My question is Are you claiming that certain issues of the JUDGE MAY Hes said they were and hes added that you banned Rilindja were banned it THE ACCUSED Interpretation Yes I understand that MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Now I claim that nobody banned the publishing of newspapers in Kosovo Now my next question Could you buy various newspapers in the Page Albanian language almost at every corner In Pristina at least A Only on  on the corner inhabited by Serbs there was no possibility of buying it otherwise yes At that time Rilindja when I first started work for it was called Bujku because in not only Rilindja but all other Albanian media were closed down Q Well how could you work in a closed Rilindja from up until the war if Rilindja had been closed down How were you able to work for it then A Rilindja continued being published  Rilindja continued being published after some specific permission was granted Otherwise  at the whims of yourself your police and your Serbian forces could close it down The newspaper was under censure And after that only after that it was allowed to get through to the readers Serbian police beat me several times simply as a result of the fact of me having been a journalist Q I am hearing for the first time that censorship was introduced von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Now how did this function How did this work work;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
What kind of censorship Who was in charge of enforcing the censorship A I do not understand how you could possibly say that it is the first time you hear of any censure when every single order came from yourself beginning with the primary schools and up to the university from the poisoning massive poisoning of over pupils They were not allowed to write about it about the truth but we found a way of doing it in order to defy the enemy This is the truth Q All right Youre not testifying about the uninational poisoning Page in Kosovo now but about other events And a moment ago you said that Rilindja came out every day except Sundays Does that mean that your paper was censored every day when it went to print Is that what you claim A Your Honour Im indebted to give him an answer to this because I was one of those who was poisoned on rd of March and to this day I continue to suffer aftereffects JUDGE MAY Help us about the censorship of the paper Can you give us some idea of how often it happened how many issues were banned or how often they were banned Can you give us a rough idea of what it was THE WITNESS Interpretation I cant give exact figures because it was banned on several occasions And at the end following the NATO air bombardment against Serb or Slav targets all newspapers were banned and;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
hundreds of people were beaten and persecuted by the accused MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Can you tell me this During all the years that you worked for Rilindja  even very roughly  for all those years how many issues of the Rilindja do you claim were banned during all the years that you worked for the newspaper Give us a very rough estimate A Im not competent to give this Q Now as a journalist do you know that in view of the Yugoslav laws and the laws of the Republic of Serbia censorship that youre referring to here is illegal and impossible A It was fully feasible by yourself The newspaper was not published on time and several issues Page Q It occurred with several issues over a number of years Now I von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm say please targets claim that they were not even several issues but I dont think well be able to establish that today So lets go back to your own statement On page of your second statement you go back once again to the subject that is actually the substance of your statement because you On the th of March I personally saw armoured vehicles belonging to the Serb police and army which had arrived from Caralluka as reinforcements to the alreadyexisting units in  A Previous translation continues please Q Could you let me read the whole of the quotation out first Now from there as well;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
as from their positions in Caralluka in the Malisevo municipality they fired in the direction of Terpeza Ladrovac Senik and Banja also Dragobil The units attacked these moving Now you are talking about reinforcements the reinforcements coming to be reinforcements to the police and army forces in the Dragobil area which was where the KLA had its headquarters and the conflicts going on there Now from what youre saying youre clearly defining conflicts between the forces of the defence of the country on the one hand and the terrorist KLA organisation on the other Is that true or not JUDGE MAY If you ask questions in that form you know you will get an answer denying that these are organisations as you describe them Theres no point with witnesses trying to make your points Its a waste of time If you want to ask if there was a conflict do but no point Page making speeches MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q And do you know that the American representative for the Balkans Robert Gelbard defined the KLA as being a terrorist organisation in February JUDGE MAY Its not a matter for the witness how he defined it Now help us with this Was there a conflict at the time that youre talking about when you say the Serb police and army were seen by you coming to reinforce troops in Malisevo and firing as you describe it as they were moving along Thats what you describe in your statement von ;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes this is true They did not fire in the direction of the KLA fighters but against civilian targets where there were killings from the shelling This is the truth MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q If that is true that what youve said how come it says at the end of the page The KLA  Im quoting Im quoting every word The KLA had positions in villages such as Bllace Gallusha which covered three villages Peqan Sllapuzhan Semetishte In addition to that Doberdolan and in the mountains in the municipality of Suva Reka Milanovic Dragobil again Dragobil and Gajrak in the municipality of Malisheva  So you have been talking about here positions of the KLA where Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page you say that it was the army that was firing at civilians You said this And again you refer to Dragobil in this set of villages where you speak of the entire area in which there were KLA units And then the paragraph says The KLA had its positions  et cetera et cetera Doesnt this deny what youve been saying all along your very own statement A Previous translation continues  had to do with kilometres I will answer about Malisheva here And I said before and Ill say it again The KLA positions were not attacked The civilian population;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
was attacked from a distance And as for the other parts of Suhareke municipality I mentioned  and I didnt mention the names of the villages because theyre not available to me  it is true that the KLA was staying there and that it fought to protect the civilian population for about ten days But it was impossible to defend what is called the Pagarushe area around Dragobil and Caravrana and Serbian police and paramilitaries went in and plundered and burned everything that was Albanian there And in the end the entire population took shelter in Bellanice That is the story Q All right That means that you are now asserting in terms of what you said just now that the KLA was fighting to protect civilians Thats what you said And a little while ago you said that the army and the police did not attack the KLA Does that mean on the basis of your statement that the KLA was shooting at the army and the police that was not attacking the KLA A Do you think that they should all be killed and people should just Page stand by and have all the Albanians killed That was why the KLA defended the civilian population There was no army that kills the population apart from the Serbian army and police Q And they didnt attack the KLA That is your assertion Yes or no A The population was attacked with tanks and with cannon and then the;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
KLA entered this melee too Q All right All right You have given a sufficient explanation in von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm terms of this particular logic of warfare Lets go back to your professional work because you say that you looked at things as an international journalist What is this international newspaper that you worked for A Its not an international newspaper I said that  I mentioned Im a member of the International Association of Journalists based in Brussels and here is the press card that I have Its not a newspaper its an identity card Here it is international press card Q All right So you didnt work for any international newspapers not a single one I mean independently of your membership card Im asking you whether you worked for an international newspaper A I didnt work for an international newspaper Im a member of the International Association of Journalists I worked for Rilindja and I think that the Federation of the International Association of Journalists takes care of journalists rights and Rilindja is a member of this association Q Im not questioning that at all I just asked you whether you Page worked for an international newspaper and I got an answer and there is no need to go into any further explanations You wrote that you were on a commission of the Crisis Staff In which capacity were you on this commission As a member of the KLA or not A He;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
always mentions the KLA and you never mention your own forces I cant give an answer to this JUDGE MAY Dont argue Take no notice of the comment You were asked about the commission and at what capacity were you on the commission Were you on it in any particular capacity or not THE WITNESS Interpretation What kind of capacity What commission here As a journalist I have my duty to my homeland to go to crisis areas JUDGE MAY I take it that theres a reference in your statement to an anticipated flow of people coming into Belanica and you say We created a commission of the emergency council for Belanica which was supposed to find shelter for the incoming people  There may be some other references intended but as far as thats concerned were you on it in any particular capacity or were you just trying to help von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm THE WITNESS Interpretation I was only trying to help MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q You wrote here that you gave instructions to the locals On the basis of what did you give instructions to the locals A I dont recollect writing this but I can say that in the village there was a commission formed for accommodation of these people who Page arrived and I kept track of events as they happened and I wrote about them in the newspaper and here are my articles for Rilindja Q All right That means;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
that on that commission you were in the capacity of some kind of a volunteer if I understand you correctly They admitted you as a voluntary member of the commission A Everybody helped each other and if the commission hadnt been formed to help the needy  as we say in Kosova this commission was very necessary When somebody is in need then this need has to be met if it is possible If its not possible then in the case of these people who had been expelled people were left outside in the rain and the snow without food And this happened People were outside in the hills Q I see that you write about the traffic police having helped you That is towards the end on page Fifteen minutes later the vehicles of the traffic police escorted us to the centre of Prizren  et cetera et cetera It seems that the traffic police helped you more than that commission of yours Is that right or is that not right Because you say that you gave instructions that they should enter vehicles that they should get out of vehicles et cetera et cetera A Where was this traffic police In which place Q Here in your statement They escorted you to Prizren They helped you go to Prizren That is what you wrote in your own statement A As I wrote and I will say clearly After the police expelled us from Bellanice by force  beating people;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
killing people  on the road at the village of Lubishte in the evening we were stopped by the traffic police and they told Page us  asked us where we were from  and we were the first vehicle in the convoy  and we said that we had come from Bellanice And the police and the paramilitaries and others in the yard of the police station of Lubishte were singing Chetnik songs The traffic police told us In von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm that you come from Bellanice and there are a lot of you you must wait a little here and from here we will escort you as far as the road to Zhur to go to Albania  I have told the Tribunal before that Im grateful to these policemen because the others didnt give any kind of help but you cant say that these police helped more than the village commission did You absolutely cant say that This is not true Q All right You are here in the position to say what is true and what is not true Since youre a journalist and since you followed events closely are you familiar with the following On the th of March when on the local road between your municipality that is to say Suva Reka and Orahovac in the village of Rreshtan in the territory of your municipality that is to say Suva Reka Albanian terrorists shot at members of the police;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
who were in a GAZ official vehicle This was on the th of March that is to say before the war started Are you familiar with this event with the fact that it took place A The war was already happening And what you say indeed there could have been people killed by Serbian forces And you have denied this You have never told the media that people were killed in Rreshtan and other places JUDGE MAY No Were getting some way from the matter Page Mr Milosevic youve had past the hour now If you have another question you can ask it or otherwise thats the end of your examination THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well I have many more questions but I think that part of this time what you restricted to one hour was used by you too and also in part by the witness with his unnecessary explanations I think that you could extend this time to me this time that you had economised with to such an extent JUDGE MAY Youve had more than the hour to allow for that Now do you want to ask him one more question or not THE ACCUSED Interpretation Of course I do How would I not want to MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q So you dont know anything about this although youre a journalist And are you aware of anything in the territory of your von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm municipality of Suva Reka of any crimes committed;0;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

criminals That is the truth And I have photographs of the burned houses and the destroyed mosques which were destroyed by the Serbian army and police This cannot be avoided This is the truth This was seen by the OSCE mission and it was also seen immediately after the war on the th of June Q I would just kindly ask you to deal with the things that are here in your statement I would just like to complete this subject by the following You also said in relation to the th of March and only then do you move on to the th of March you say that there were artillery attacks that the KLA held by the Serb forces and then aircraft were used and that was also on the th of March according to your statement A I didnt say on the th of March Please look at it properly I Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts Page said during the time of the OSCE mission Its all written here Ive also written the number of this missile which was metres with the year of when it was produced Q At any rate it was before the th All of this was before the th of March happened A No This  this happened on the th On the th this Q Yes precisely Thats how Id like to finish Today;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

for years on end Kumarani was also under the Serbian police and army People were always beaten up and there was a lot of plundering And one of those people  I was one of those people I was taken by the police in and possessions were taken off me Q Im interested in There were refugees who came to your village At that time due to the conflicts that were taking place between the KLA and the Yugoslav army or police were people moving to more peaceful areas Yes or no And let us conclude with that A No one in Kumarani was There were only Serbian tanks police army and the paramilitary The population had to go somewhere for safe shelter and thats why they sought quieter spots And if you want to confirm whether the people left or not let me tell you what happened earlier not on that particular day alone because I went through that And if youre not interested Im not interested either Please Your Honour Q Sir I am certainly interested in that but here we are dealing with your statement only We cannot deal with things that are not contained in your statement Thank you MR TAPUSKOVIC Interpretation Thank you Your Honours JUDGE MAY Yes Any reexamination MS ROMANO Yes Your Honour just one question Page Reexamined by Ms Romano Q Mr Zogaj in your statement  A Yes Q In your second statement you said that because of the shelling of;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
the abovementioned villages and you mentioned several villages from von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm March on the villagers start to flee to Belanica I want to clarify Mr Zogaj one matter The villagers they fled because of the attack because of the shelling and the actions of the Serbian forces that you described or the villagers left because of the subsequent fighting between the  that happened between the Serb forces and the KLA that was defending the village A You said on March the th The civilian population did not leave on March the th But from March the th people reached Bellanice because it was a quieter place And the whole area was in flames Basa Hoxhaj was in flames There was killing There was pillaging Serbian police and army went into the villages with heavy vehicles Q So Mr Zogaj I want a clear answer Between the two scenarios that I gave to you that they were fleeing because of the attacks of the Serbian force or the actions or they were fleeing because there was fighting between the KLA that was defending the village and the Serb forces what was the reason that they left A At Bellanice on April the st there was no KLA There were no Page KLA positions There never have been I can say this with full responsibility Q Mr Zogaj youre not understanding the question The question is that in your statement you said that several villages;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
were attacked from March on and that the villagers started to flee towards Belanica I want to know what is the reason why the villagers started to go to Belanica Was it because they were afraid or they were leaving because of the attacks or because of the fighting between the KLA and the Serb forces A In the beginning in March a number of the civilian population left Suhareke On the th of March immediately after the NATO bombardment against Serbian targets in Kosova and Yugoslavia the civilian population in Suhareke was in a miserable situation from the early hours of the morning onwards and this continued for days on end Other witnesses have testified to this as well From this day they came into Bellanice Q Concentrate on the question that Im making What was the reason that the villagers left and they start going to Belanica What were they von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm afraid of They were afraid of the attacks or they were afraid about the fighting between the KLA and the Serb forces A The reason was because they found themselves being targets of continuous onslaughts and thats why they came to seek shelter in our village Whereas the KLA which was protecting us finding it impossible to defend its positions withdrew tactically into other villages And that is how the population at Bellanice came to find itself at the centre of Serbian police and army attacks Page Q My last;1;2;Shefqet Zogaj;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
question You say that the reason was because they found themselves being targets  being targets of continuous onslaught Who was doing that A The civilian population The civilian population was always the target of the police and the Serbian army Beginning at on the st of April the situation was very desperate Q Thank you Mr Zogaj MS ROMANO No further questions THE WITNESS Interpretation Thank you JUDGE MAY Mr Zogaj that concludes your evidence Thank you for coming to the International Tribunal to give it Youre free to go Well adjourn now for half an hour THE WITNESS Interpretation Thank you very much The witness withdrew  Recess taken at a m  On resuming at a m The witness entered court JUDGE MAY Yes Let the witness take the declaration WITNESS OSMAN KUCI Witness answered through interpreter THE WITNESS Interpretation I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth JUDGE MAY Thank you very much If youd like to take a seat Examined by Ms Romano Page Q Mr Kuci can you please give the Court your full name Excuse me Do you want to put on your headphones A In English I do understand Interpretation My name is Osman von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Kuci Q When were you born Mr Kuci A I was born in in Suhareke Q And Suva Reka is located in which municipality A It is a municipality in its;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

Reka and that later on you opened a bar a coffee bar A Yes Q Now linked to your business with respect to the shop and your catering establishment the bar you worked in was that in order Did everything function normally Page A No not normally but in rather difficult situations Q So why was it rather difficult You say you had a shop You had a bar afterwards Now what was difficult about the situation then A There were difficulties coming as a result of the administration of the time the taxes financial police All of them created difficulties for people in small businesses like myself and my brother And we were unable to operate as the result of the administration of the time which created a number of problems and obstacles for us Q But as far as Im able to understand you did work throughout that time A We worked only to the extent that we could survive Q But that was the same for everybody owners of shops or anybody who had any other business But did you have a special problem perhaps that was not shared by everybody else in the country When you  or we talk about taxes and financial inspection and so on and so forth did you encounter any specific problems A Yes mainly having to do with taxes and inspections from the financial police which very often worked outside their remit They wanted bribes which we gave them And;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
police which were sheltered near our  in a hotel near our shop they often came and got commodities which von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm they did not pay for Q Were there shops and bars like that owned by Serbs or were they just own by Albanians Albanian proprietors A In that area there were no shops where Serbs worked There was only my shop and then that is what I can answer for Page Q So you dont know about any others A I was not interested in the others Q All right Were not going to dwell on that then When did you start working for the Kosovo diplomatic mission A As Ive said in my statement that was in October November Q Yes But later on you began working for the OSCE mission What Im asking you is how long you worked for the diplomatic mission before you became employed by the OSCE A After two months the diplomatic mission was transformed into the OSCE mission in Kosovo Q So for those two months you worked for the American Diplomatic Observer Mission is that right A Yes Q And later on when it became integrated with the OSCE mission did you continue working for the American part of that observer mission A When it was transformed into the OSCE there was no American part It was only known as the OSCE Q In the American observer mission the one you worked for before;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
working for the OSCE were there you the only interpreter or were there other Albanians working as interpreters with the mission A At Suhareke there were about interpreters THE ACCUSED Interpretation I should like to draw the attention of the technical booth to the fact that I am getting interference between Page the two channels the Albanian channel and the Serbian channel So there seems to be a technical problem This is something that I havent had any trouble with so far JUDGE MAY Well see if that can be put right THE ACCUSED Interpretation Im going to listen to the channels and see what Im getting over channel which is the Serbian von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm interpretation But lets continue I assume that the technical booth will be able to put that right soon MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Did you  were you doing the interpretation when members of the American observer mission had contacts with the representatives of the A No No I never had any meetings with the KLA in this capacity Q And later on while you were employed in the Verification Mission did you do the interpreting for a meeting at which representatives of the Verification Mission talked to representatives of the KLA KLA A No Q Did you ever have occasion to meet in your capacity as an employee of KDOM or as an employee in the Kosovo Verification Mission some representatives of the KLA A Yes We saw members;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
of the KLA on our patrols Q Now the representatives of those missions did they talk to them on that occasion or not A Yes they did Sometimes they talked THE INTERPRETER The interpreter requests the witness to draw Page near the microphone MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q That means that you translated for them right JUDGE MAY Mr Kuci  yes You got the message THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes Yes We also translated when there was need for members of the KLA or the Yugoslav army or the police MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q How often did you interpret for the members of the KLA while you were working with the American KDOM A As far as I remember twice And these were short meetings meetings on the street not official meetings Q And what did those talks have to do with at the brief meetings that you had which you say were not official meetings What did they discuss A Im not competent to discuss the conversations that took place Im not an official who could explain what these conversations were von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Q Well Im asking you what was discussed because those discussions went through you So you physically had to hear both sides for you to be able to interpret A Indeed We interpreted for both sides But we are not authorised to convey the substance of what was said THE ACCUSED Interpretation Mr May may I have an explanation as to;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
whether the witness is dutybound to say what he knows here or does he have the right to refrain Because as he has just said in view of Page the fact that he took the solemn declaration here that he would speak the truth what the position is JUDGE MAY When you say Mr Kuci youre not authorised to say what was said in those conversations what are you referring to Was this something you signed when you joined the OSCE Tell us what the authority is THE WITNESS Interpretation I think that the substance of the conversation which is something I didnt take notes about I think this is a matter for representatives of the OSCE I havent signed anything to say that I wont speak but its not my place to discuss the content of what was said between members of the KLA and the members of the OSCE mission conversation JUDGE MAY Were you told by anybody not to repeat the THE WITNESS Interpretation No JUDGE MAY Was there a general rule in the OSCE that interpreters should not repeat conversations which they had to interpret Was there any notion of confidentiality THE WITNESS Interpretation Normally we had to maintain the confidentiality of what was said Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Mr Ryneveld can you assist us on this matter As far as the OSCE is concerned do you know of any policy or the like MR RYNEVELD To be absolutely honest Your Honour I do not;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
know of any policy other than the one of general confidentiality to which the witness has referred It seems to me however that the witness is being brought forward to give evidence and I know of no sort of Rule basis Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm whereby this evidence could not be elicited If it does become a matter of a substance  especially the context of what hes saying now  it wasnt an official meeting it was on the street  I dont see how the Prosecution can take the view that we would be opposing On the other hand I cannot speak for the OSCE other than this witness is under a general rule of confidentiality But surely when coming before this Tribunal to give evidence unless its covered by Rule its for Your Honours to decide as to whether or not he ought divulge the nature of that conversation JUDGE ROBINSON Of course Mr Ryneveld if the evidence related to security matters the OSCE itself would be interested in the confidentiality of that kind of information MR RYNEVELD Absolutely Your Honour And since I do not know what the subject matter of this conversation was any more than  its not in the statement Im not in a position to assist the Court on that matter other than Im not aware of anything specific which prohibits this witness from testifying to those questions which the Court permits him to answer JUDGE MAY;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
Thank you Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Mr Kuci well hear what the evidence is You are here of course to tell the truth and we think that obligation overrides any general obligation But if the question relates to security at all Page or may relate to security of the OSCE or something of that sort then we will consider ordering the question not to be answered We note that you say you took no notes of the conversation If you can remember what was said say so but if you cant say that you cant remember if thats the position But do your best to answer the questions if theyre relevant and you can answer them Yes Mr Milosevic THE WITNESS Interpretation Well I can say that the OSCE had meetings and had published its report became public And the meetings where I was an interpreter were short encounters for instance on the street where members of the OSCE met representatives of the KLA and asked what the situation was like Is everything in order Has there been any gunfire And for instance Today Serbian police and army convoy passed von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm in a certain direction Or where the Yugoslav army was deployed And from here we would move on to other places JUDGE MAY So to summarise these were short conversations generally about the deployment of troops or forces that sort of topic THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes JUDGE MAY Yes MR MILOSEVIC;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
Interpretation Q So it is your assertion that these two conversations that you mentioned pertained exclusively in terms of their substance to the Serb side Were there any conversations about and did any of the subject matter pertain to that particular interlocutors side that is to say the KLA Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page A Could you make the question clearer please Q It was my understanding that your explanation was that the contents of this conversation that is to say the questions and the answers between your employers and the representatives of the KLA pertained exclusively to information related to the Serb side Is that right these convoys A No There were also conversations with members of the KLA between members of the KLA and the Yugoslav army at checkpoints and the like when a convoy of humanitarian aid had to pass and the OSCE checked Q But Im talking about the conversations that you mentioned What was the substance of that part of the conversations that related to the KLA not the movement of convoys of the Serb army and police A The content of the conversation was for instance Whats the situation like Is there any gunfire Are there any problems These were the kinds of conversations we had both with the KLA and with members of the Serbian forces It was mainly members of the mission asking KLA;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
members what the situation was like in their areas and where gunfire came from if there was any Q On the basis of what youve been saying can one infer that the members of the mission only put questions to the KLA that they encountered on the way that pertained to the Serb forces or did they also ask questions that pertained to their forces A They asked members of the KLA if there had been gunfire but they would also ask the Serbian forces if there had been gunfire They would ask similar questions to both sides Page Q Who were the people that you were interpreting for in KDOM You met them You worked with them for months Who were these people A I should say again that in KDOM and in the OSCE Verification Mission there were lots of people and I cant really remember their names Im not sure that I can discuss these people Q Well I assume that you worked with the same people during that time while you worked or perhaps this is not correct A We didnt work always with one person or with one team We moved von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm around Q And how long did you work with the same team A Normally we worked for three days with the same team Q Three days In three days you can probably establish who these people are Can you say anything about who these people are;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
JUDGE MAY What is the relevance of this THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well the relevance will be shown by my further questions JUDGE MAY Then ask your further questions to show the relevance MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Were these people civilians or military persons A These people were civilians Q You say that they were civilians Does that pertain both to KDOM and to the Kosovo Verification Mission A Yes All the people I met were civilians and I didnt ask about Page their particular fields of expertise MR RYNEVELD Your Honours JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Ryneveld MR RYNEVELD Your Honours in response to the question you asked me earlier although I outlined our general position I must say that the line of questioning now  and this is of course for the Court to determine  is completely outside the scope other than passing reference to his employment of the nature of the statement that this witness has been tendered for In other words I leave it to the Court to determine how relevant it is but I want to note for the record that there is nothing in his statements about his work with the KDOM or OSCE And I leave it to the Court but I thought I should make that observation JUDGE MAY Yes Weve allowed the questions because the witness did work for them and theres been evidence about them But so far nothing very relevant has appeared Yes Mr Milosevic Bear in mind youve got;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
to show relevance for any of this THE ACCUSED Interpretation No doubt the witness did mention in his statement that he worked for the American KDOM and then for the Kosovo Verification Mission I think that the examinations of witnesses to date von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm notably of General Drewienkiewicz and Lieutenant Colonel Ciaglinski indicated the relevance of the substance of the work of the Verification Mission the presence of a large number of military personnel on the mission and also many elements that indicated that the mission largely focused on preparations for the NATO aggression Since the witness worked Page for the mission  JUDGE MAY That is all a matter of argument and you can make your submissions in due course This witness said he worked for civilians MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q All right You said that you met the members of the KLA only in the street You would meet them only in the street Where would you meet them Can you determine that more specifically What does in the street mean A On the street not in the sense of while walking around but in villages where groups of the KLA were where they had checkpoints of various kinds just as the police had in the areas controlled by the Yugoslav police and army So that at the entrance to a village there would be a checkpoint with two soldiers of the KLA And this was the way in which we met;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
people Q And when you would enter a village would you talk to any KLA A I didnt have any opportunity to talk to KLA commanders or members members then of the KLA Q It was my understanding that you said that you were in these conversations twice in these situations of conversations between your employers and representatives of the KLA that that was at the time when you worked for the American KDOM Is that right A No This was with the OSCE When I was working for the American KDOM I wasnt involved in conversations with members of the KLA Page Q All right Lets go on Let us continue with your statement In paragraph page at the very end Since you describe the number  the colours of the uniforms of the army and the police you say I was never in a position to see their shoulder patches  Can I understand that to mean that you were not in any close von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm contact with them since you used the word never  that you could never see them That is to say that you never had any close contact with the military or with the police the kind of close contact which makes it possible for you to see their shoulder patches A Youre referring to the Serbian army and police arent you Q Yes Yes I am talking about your statement and what it contains that is;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
to say that you were never in that kind of contact with them that would make it possible for you to see their shoulder patches A Yes During work with the OSCE yes I was close And the Serbian place had the blue camouflage  JUDGE MAY The examiner has moved on and hes asking you about a passage in your statement Mr Kuci when the OSCE had left and Serb forces moved in to Suva Reka and you were able to see various units in the town and you said that the VJ wore green camouflage uniforms and the MUP had blue camouflage uniforms but you said you were never in a position to see their shoulder patches Is that right THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes That is precisely what I want to clarify During work for the OSCE yes we were was in close contact and I was able to see the shoulder patches But after the departure of the OSCE mission it was only normal that I wasnt close enough and I was Page only observing their positions at a distance from my house I could only see which one was a police uniform which one was an army uniform but I wasnt close enough to see that I could only see that from the window of my house MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q In paragraph page of the other statement you say and Im going to quote the entire sentence I also wish to say that I was;0;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
told that when the OSCE leaves Kosovo I should hide so that the Serb police would not arrest me It is for that reason that I never left my apartment  Who said to you that you should hide so that the Serb police would not arrest you You say that you were told Who said that to you A The head of the OSCE mission in Suhareke said this Q As a matter of fact you move on to say that you were aware that you might be killed However your statement shows that you were in contact with the police that nobody arrested you and that nobody harmed von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm you Is that right or is that not right A After the departure of the mission it was obvious that an interpreter who should work for the OSCE could be a target I personally was not harmed but perhaps others were killed I know that I was threatened as Ive stated there in my statement Just before passing the border they put myself at gunpoint and I could say that I was near death there Q Yes But your entire statement which refers to your departure and crossing the border refers to several contacts you had with the police Page but nobody arrested you although they knew that you had worked for the OSCE Is that right or is that not right A I do not know how clear this is When;1;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
I left the house and until I reached the point Im not sure that every single policeman ought to have known that I worked for the OSCE They might not I was part of a convoy with other people that were leaving Q All right Lets move on It is quite clear that nothing happened to you After all that is something that you never claimed anyway Towards the end of page the third paragraph from the bottom  Im referring to your second statement  you say that you travelled to Kukes with a person a woman who told you that the inhabitants of the village were told to go to Albania Thats what it says here The police kept some of the men in the village They were lined up at the school and executed She did not see the execution So that person did not see the execution that she told you about So you heard about an execution from a person who is not an eyewitness of that execution herself Is that right or is that not right A As stated there she was there She helped us She wanted a lift in our tractor As I said she said that they held all the males and they let the women alone as she has described it The men were lined up for execution So basically what Im trying to say is that she left she hasnt seen them and I havent seen them either Q;1;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
All right Thats what I wanted to hear Then towards the end of your statement you say  your statement is short  the beginning of the second page The police and the army did Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm not escort us except for the fact that we saw police cars on the way Then we came to Prizren  And the last sentence in your statement reads We crossed without being insulted or illtreated  Is that right A Actually my family and myself were not illtreated physically On the route to Prizren we saw Serbian police and civilian Serbs which were driving in the opposite direction at high speed And as Ive said around Prizren we were insulted with the specific words that Ive mentioned there Go away Youll never return You asked for NATO to come in NATO will help you now  and so on and so forth and other words to this effect or illtreated  Is that right Q You said in the last sentence We passed without being insulted JUDGE MAY Yes That is the border Before that he describes in the statement various incidents including having to give them money THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes that is correct A few metres to the border where the convoy had been stopped  because not everybody could pass speedily through There was a very long convoy So waiting in that convoy there were two policemen who pointed their pistol towards;1;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
me and they asked me for my money or be killed and I gave them money as Ive explained over there The same happened to my brother They threatened him with a pistol in his chest and took his money away I consider this to be a grave insult I do not know what kind of other Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm English transcripts insults you could be referring to MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Page Q Im quoting your own statement when I put these questions to you As for what you have been claiming in terms of what happened to you of course it would have been hard had it happened However during my crossexamination Ive been trying to establish what is true out of all the things that youve said I cant find a particular section now but didnt you write down here that you were a teacher for a time before you went into this other business A Yes Q Where did you work as a teacher A In Suhareke secondary school Which school A Primary Q The name of the school Q In which school did you work in Suva Reka Elementary school A It was called the th of March Shtate Mars school in Suhareke Q How many teachers were there in that school A I do not know the exact number but it is about or Q How many pupils;1;2;Osman Kuci;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

the way on the nd of April the witness and her group arrived at Klina Police in Klina directed them onto trucks driven by gypsies heading towards the village of Volujak Tanks and troops lined the road to Volujak and from there they walked towards Djakovica The police didnt stop the refugees but maintained checkpoints along the road When the convoy arrived at Djakovica walking through the citys outskirts the witness saw neighbourhoods on fire shops damaged and destroyed The witness and her group followed the other refugees from Djakovica suspecting they would know the quickest route to the border They were not provided with food or water and the witness heard that young women taken from the convoy had probably been raped and illtreated On the th of April the refugees left Djakovica and walked to the border crossing of Qafe e Prushit There she saw a large presence von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm of Serb forces on the road from Djakovica to the border and the Serb forces told the refugees that the area on either side of the road was mined and that they should hurry to the border as NATO might attack To reach the border the refugees had to climb a steep hill leaving some of the elderly and sick behind That is the general outline of her statement and I have no further questions JUDGE MAY Thank you Well adjourn now Crossexamination after the break Page MR RYNEVELD Thank you Might;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
I also at the beginning of the next session raise a brief issue with the Court about clarification of the Courts interpretation of the number of witnesses JUDGE MAY Yes MR RYNEVELD Thank you JUDGE MAY By all means Ms Fazliu were going to adjourn now for an hour and a half Could you remember not to speak to anybody about your evidence in the adjournment and until its over and that does include members of the Prosecuting team Would you be back please at half past  Luncheon recess taken at p m Page  On resuming at p m JUDGE MAY This is a ruling of the Trial Chamber on the facilities provided for the accused for his defence von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm The procedural background is as follows The accused has on a number of occasions complained about the lack of facilities available to him to conduct his defence Further to an undertaking given by the amicus curiae on the th of February the amici curiae filed a Brief on the provision of adequate facilities to allow the accused to prepare his defence  and on the th of March the Trial Chamber ordered the Registry to provide a report on the facilities available to him This report was filed on the th of March and was discussed during public session on the th of April at which time both the accused and the amici curiae made various observations as to the adequacy;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
of the facilities provided Article of the Statute sets out certain minimum guarantees to which an accused appearing before the Tribunal is entitled including the right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence The Trial Chamber has reviewed the report from the Registry relating to the facilities provided to the accused and is satisfied that all possible efforts are being made to assist him As a general principle the accused is treated in the same way as all other accused Any variations have been put in place by the Registry in an attempt to assist him in light of the fact that he wishes to conduct his own defence Page First and contrary to the repeated assertions of the accused he is not and never has been kept in isolation He is allowed to mix with other detainees at the Detention Unit and to receive visits in accordance with the standard procedures As a result the accused receives regular visits from members of his family and from representatives of various organisations The regime for legal visits  by which I mean visits that are fully confidential  has been complicated by the fact that for many months the accused refused to identify those persons with whom he wished to communicate and then when such visits were offered by lawyers that he had asked to meet he declined to communicate with those persons That position is now resolved following the appointment of two persons as his;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
associates and the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the accused has von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence as guaranteed by Article of the Statute The accused can now meet with his two associates on a confidential basis at the Tribunal during breaks in the court proceedings and at the Detention Unit at the end of the day The length of these visits is governed by the regulations in place at both the Detention Unit and the Dutch prison in which it is located which apply to all detainees and their counsel He can also communicate freely with the two associates by telephone from the Detention Unit including at the weekend and as an exception not available to other detainees who have appointed Defence Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page counsel by telephone from the Tribunal during the day The associates can help the accused in making photocopies and sending faxes at the premises of the Tribunal during the day and limited facilities are also available to do this at the Detention Unit In addition to facilities similar to those provided to the other detainees the Registry also provides additional copies of documents served in the proceedings for him to discuss with his associates The accused may review video material and use a computer in his cell although for security reasons it is not;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
permitted for any accused to have email and Internet access Yes That concludes the ruling Mr Ryneveld there was a matter you wanted to raise MR RYNEVELD Yes Thank you Your Honour Actually two matters if I may The first is a response to Your Honours question to me this morning about the witness statement Our records indicate that we in fact had produced the witness statements of that witness to the Senior Legal Officer on the th of April and then additional copies were provided on the nd of April So hopefully copies of that witness statement have made their way to Your Honours JUDGE MAY That appears to be the position I now understand but equally weve made no ruling upon it MR RYNEVELD I appreciate that JUDGE MAY So we will at an appropriate time have to make a ruling MR RYNEVELD I understand that I was just responding to your Page issue about getting the statement to you for review so you could make a ruling Thank you The second matter Your Honour deals with a comment by the Court I believe it was last Monday concerning the witnesses And just so that Im completely clear about to what extent the Court is referring to witnesses my understanding was back on the th of January and the th of January when the issue of witnesses came up  Ive checked the record and the Court asked me to deal with a point in the order and;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
I indicated to the Court that we then anticipated calling witnesses by way of viva voce evidence of the potential that we had put in our von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm ter filing I then outlined to the Court the numbers and how they were broken down But I also indicated that the Prosecution proposes to call by way of viva voce evidence and with the leave of the Court will tender crimebase witnesses by way of bis statements And I indicated that the Prosecution would then seek leave of the Court to call additional witnesses viva voce in the event the Court didnt grant permission for those witnessess evidence to be submitted by way of bis Then at that time the Court clarified with me how I arrived at the figure and the exchange went something like this JUDGE MAY In the document there are numbers for the live witnesses and there appear at the moment to be live witnesses that youve numbered with the possibility of a further MR RYNEVELD Yes Page JUDGE MAY Would that be right Thats your MR RYNEVELD Thats my JUDGE MAY Then we have your bis your written statements and they number up to  is this right  to MR RYNEVELD Thats absolutely correct  The Court then indicated JUDGE MAY We consider that a total of  THE INTERPRETER Mr Ryneveld please slow down when reading MR RYNEVELD Sorry Im apologising to the interpreters for reading too fast;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
JUDGE MAY We consider that a total of witnesses should be sufficient having regard to size and complexity of the case but that will not prevent you from making the application during the trial for additional witnesses on good cause for challenge if the witnesses come forward  And then the Court went on to talk about looking at the bis statements out In the written order of the th of January the Trial Chamber set von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm The Trial Chamber sets the number of witnesses the Prosecution may call in person at with leave to apply to the Chamber for permission to present additional witnesses The Trial Chamber  Page THE INTERPRETER Excuse me sir Would you mind reading out a bit more slowly Thank you very much MR RYNEVELD Ive again been cautioned to read more slowly Secondly the Trial Chamber instructs the Prosecution to review the proposed list of witnesses whose evidence is to be presented by way of statements pursuant to bis so as to avoid repetition and orders that the applications for admission of such evidence be made forthwith on completion of the certification and translation processes  Now Ive read that by way of background Your Honour just to see  because it makes a lot of difference to our planning whether we are in fact restricted to a total of witnesses My understanding was that we were restricted to a total of live witnesses plus consideration to;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
be given for bis Now weve cut down that live witnesses considerably and weve also cut down our anticipated bis witnesses considerably but the total of both of them will exceed witnesses Thats the problem And we were thinking that the question now becomes whether what was a bis witness because of the procedure were now adopting is interpreted by the Chamber to have become a live witness Thats my problem I assumed not and Ive been operating on the basis that the bis witness is not included in the total Now it may be somewhat academic in light of the fact that we have a finite date whereby we have to complete all our witnesses I Page understand that But I just hope that Im not at crosspurposes with your order to think Im allowed up to live witnesses plus bis witnesses JUDGE MAY Speaking for myself I think that the circumstances are different from those in which we originally made the order First of all when we made the order it related to Kosovo alone MR RYNEVELD Yes von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm JUDGE MAY The second matter is that the procedure which has now been adopted relating to bis witnesses which was not one foreseen at the time it would seem to me sensible to review the whole matter again in the light of the present circumstances Trial Chamber confers MR RYNEVELD I would certainly appreciate that Its just that when Your Honour mentioned;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
the other day that I was restricted to I had to ask for clarification So if Your Honours are prepared to reconsider in light of the developments that have happened and give us further guidance  JUDGE MAY Yes MR RYNEVELD  keeping in mind you have indicated July is the target date for completion  JUDGE MAY Yes MR RYNEVELD  Id be grateful Thank you JUDGE MAY Well perhaps you could assist us by making an application MR RYNEVELD I certainly will JUDGE MAY  for review of the order and we can then review it in light of the all the circumstances MR RYNEVELD Well do that as soon as we possibly can Thank Page you Your Honour I appreciate it Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Milosevic THE ACCUSED Interpretation In relation to what youve said I just want to clarify the facts of the matter Actually I didnt ask for anything I just wanted it to be made quite clear that I have been prevented from having what I call normal means of ensuring an equality the way it is understood anywhere in the world and everything that you have been insisting upon allegedly JUDGE MAY We are not prepared to enter into further discussion about it That was a ruling We will look into the matter of the telephone Now if theres some fresh matter you want to raise you can but were not going to go back over what weve dealt with;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
already THE ACCUSED Interpretation All right Then I wont deal with the obvious But I want to draw your attention to a few facts a few von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm material facts that are not in line with what you have received reports on The question of isolation you said a few minutes ago loud and and what youve just read clear in public  JUDGE MAY We are not prepared for continued submissions on this point You raised an issue today about the telephone We will have that looked into further although we understand that youve been phoning unauthorised numbers and thats why you havent got through But we will check that out Page Now that that I read out was a ruling Weve considered all the matters and theres no point going on arguing about it THE ACCUSED Interpretation I am not speaking about your ruling at all Your ruling is your own affair I just want to explain that the facts stand differently Namely you said that is what they wrote out for you that I was never in isolation I was in isolation for months JUDGE MAY We  we are not prepared to enter into further argument about this Weve had the matter looked into and weve given this ruling and that for the moment is that If you want to make an application another application in due course well consider it but theres no point arguing about it today Were;0;2;Hadije Fazliu;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

same year of there was no security at all Q Please I will phrase my question very carefully You did not leave the village before a Serb policeman was killed in that village is that right A The policeman was brought in the hills of the village of Resnik I do not know who killed him I only know that from the date Im referring to theres no peace in this household so we had to spend our life in the woods coming back home before dusk and then leaving the house Q In your village at that time there was the KLA Is that right or again before dawn is that not right A There was a KLA but not in my village Theres no wooded areas in my village i e no basis for a war It is in the open For it to have a basis we need to have wooded areas to hide in there But neither the people nor the KLA would have been in a position to be there because the terrain is inappropriate for war There was a KLA present but not there Page Q A little while ago you said that they took away a policeman into the hills but that you did not know who killed him If there was no KLA in the village who was it that took the policeman into the hills A I dont know anything about this I havent followed this incident I didnt follow what;1;2;Sadik Januzi;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002
the KLA was doing I was dealing with my family My family has ten members and I was concerned with gathering them together and then in Klladernica and then we went off to Albania These were my concerns Q Yes but a short while ago you said that a policeman was taken into the hills Thats what you said not me And since you say They took a policeman into the hills  my question is Who took a policeman von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm into the hills JUDGE MAY He says he doesnt know A I dont know I dont know about this MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q I am just asking What is the noun that stands next to the verb did Or when it says They took him  So whats the noun preceding took Whats the subject Who is it JUDGE MAY He cant help you further He says he doesnt know MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation All right Q So you do not know that the policeman was killed by the KLA is that right JUDGE MAY Hes dealt with it MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation All right A I dont know Page Q In and several times you left Brocina and went back to Brocina together with your family is that right A Thats right That went on for almost a year Q Otherwise we heard a few minutes ago from your summary that you went through different villages in that area during that year Is;0;2;Sadik Januzi;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

right We lived in that municipality but on the border with the municipality of Klina Q When I say Srbica  Im referring to the municipality of Srbica and not the town of Srbica We heard from the Prosecution that you passed through villages during that year or year and a half JUDGE MAY It must be a misunderstanding MR RYNEVELD If I may correct it since I authored the summary and not the witness The forces attacked villages As a result of that the witness moved from village to village I didnt suggest that he moved to all villages Its my summary and not the witnesss statement Whats correct is whats in his statement and the accused has that at paragraph and THE ACCUSED Interpretation All right Then I misunderstood this that the Prosecutor was speaking of the witnesss testimony because he did invoke the witnesss statement when he referred to villages So he spoke of something that the witness did not refer to in his own statement This created that confusion on my part Let us proceed now MR RYNEVELD With respect Your Honour I did not confuse What I said in the summary is He describes an ongoing offensive by Serb forces during which time they attacked about villages in the Drenica region and repeatedly shelled his village of Broje  Next sentence As a result the witness and his family were forced to constantly move from Page village to village over a period of months ;0;2;Sadik Januzi;020424IT;IT-02-54;24.04.2002

started as a driver It is true that I travelled a lot around a large part of the Balkans apart  as far as Austria Italy and so on Q The point of my question was to say that you were well acquainted with the situation and circumstances in Pec and as they were just before the war is that right A Yes Relatively well Im relatively wellinformed Q Yes And the fact that before working in transport you worked in the Slovenia bank was also a job which meant communicating with people and learning quite a bit in the process is that correct A Yes thats true Q What were during those prewar years the relationships in Pec like Can you tell us briefly in one or two sentences Describe what the relationships were like A I can answer but you must make clear in which period of time whether its before you came to power or afterwards Q Im talking about the period just before the war Now you can Page talk about whatever period you like but what Im asking you is just before the war the period just prior to the war which means to be more specific A Even though this period was a very difficult one because our movements were very restricted at this time relations between the Albanians and the Serbs were very chilly They were especially chilly after the mysterious murders that started in Peja in with the murder of the Gjuka;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
brothers the murder of Dr Ceku the murder of Dr Xhevad Gashi and of Emin Basha This led to relations cooling considerably Q Do you know who killed these Albanians the Albanians that youve just mentioned A In this period particularly in Peja this was an open secret These murders were directed and carried out by a notorious organisation called the Black Hand which particularly at dusk and at dawn it kidnapped Albanians that were on the streets accidently and then nothing von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm more was heard of them And they may well  they were often found the next day dead Q I dont know which Black Hand organisation youre talking about We know about one organisation called Crna Ruka or Black Hand which dates back a hundred years And that one ceased to exist a long time ago It has joined the rank of history So what Black Hand are you talking about A I dont know anything about the Black Hand organisation which was formed years ago but I know that it continued its work in Peja and its members were regular policemen who during the day did police work and Page during the night committed cruel murders in our city Q And what is it that youre looking for in the papers you have in front of you Are you looking for the Black Hand perhaps A No Fortunately I did not experience the work of the Black Hand in;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
Peja before the war Q Well do tell us then please Do tell us then please at least who told you about this Black Hand A There was a lot of talk about the Black Hand in Peja at that time and I can say Ive got a few members of this organisation here in my notes and they included my neighbours And as I said before there was a lot of talk about this organisation in our city JUDGE MAY Just help with us this Mr Zatriqi What are the notes which you have in front of you THE WITNESS Interpretation These notes that I have are about the period before the war and the moment of my deportation along with my fellow citizens JUDGE MAY And when did you make the notes THE WITNESS Interpretation I made these notes at the time when these events happened All the notes I had I put into a computer and then printed them out Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Yes MR KAY Your Honour might I assist the Court that the notes there look handwritten to me and on the top of the page We seem to be having a succession of witnesses now bringing notes into the courtroom Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm and one really questions whether that is desirable given the fact that this is crossexamination by the accused at this stage the witnesses have their statement produced as exhibits a summary given to;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
the Court and it might be more helpful to the proceedings if they just answered the questions unaided rather than referring to notes that may well have a different history and background that could cloud the issues JUDGE ROBINSON Mr Kay this would meet your requirement of contemporaneity MR KAY We havent really gone into this in great detail with the witness as to when and scrutinised the document and questioned him upon it as to when it actually arose and whether matters were fresh in his mind at the time I take Your Honours point that it well may be an issue of contemporaneity here Notes of course can have a long period of time to justify contemporaneity Its the issue really with which I raise the matter to the Court because it may be unhelpful to the evidence if such material is going to be relied upon JUDGE ROBINSON I mention that Mr Kay because even when the notes do not meet that requirement with which youre familiar in your system we sometimes allow witnesses to refresh their memories from notes which are made even subsequent to the event because ultimately we have to assess the weight that is to be given to the evidence But I think well consult on this Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Mr Zatriqi we will allow you to refer to your notes but if you can give your evidence without reference to them because its Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts Page your evidence we want not whats written in your notes But if you need to refresh your memory on a particular point you can do so And Ms Romano as far as the witnesses are concerned perhaps the better course would be in future that if they want to refer to their notes particularly then they can ask permission to do so if theyve made notes and brought them along But on the whole the witnesses of course should give evidence without notes but simply giving it So if the Prosecution would take note of that and in future if they want to they perhaps should mention it MS ROMANO Your Honour I just want to clarify that when they come to The Hague they come with several material accompanied and the instruction of the Prosecution is in the same lines that what is important is their evidence But sometimes you know they just come to the Court because they feel afraid of forgetting Its more of a helpful tool JUDGE MAY Yes Well if they want  MS ROMANO I will take care JUDGE MAY If they want to provide it  if they were made roughly at the time  if they want to refer to it they can but they should ask MS ROMANO Well take care of that JUDGE MAY Well adjourn now Its past the time Mr Zatriqi were;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
going to adjourn for half an hour During the von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm adjournment please remember not to speak to anybody about your evidence until its over and that does include members of the Prosecution team Well adjourn for half an hour Page  Recess taken at a m  On resuming at a m JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Milosevic THE ACCUSED Interpretation Since you took a break after you conferred about the notes I would just wish to state that nowhere in the witnesss statement the two written statements he gave has it been said that he used notes while giving his statement If he didnt do it then I dont understand why he would do it now That goes for other witnesses as well JUDGE MAY If you want to ask him about it you can THE ACCUSED Interpretation I am stating that in the statement there is no mention of that because I assume that if the witness had resorted to notes while giving his statement it would have to be noted by your official All right JUDGE MAY Lets move on MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Yes So you spoke of the atmosphere the atmosphere that was hampered by crimes You mentioned some unresolved killings murders My question is Do you know that these killings were committed by the KLA A No You are wrong These were not committed by the KLA Q How come you know that it wasnt the KLA that;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
did it when you say no that it wasnt the KLA That means that you know that they didnt do it to the end A First dont interrupt me but listen to me Listen to my answers Page JUDGE MAY Now listen Mr Zatriqi You must remember youre in a court And just answer the questions if you please THE WITNESS Interpretation My answer is as I said before that it was an open secret in Peja and we knew that this organisation was working in Peja in and And at this time we didnt even dare to go out of our houses Or when we went out we did so for very short periods von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation precisely launched by the KLA Q And do you know that this rumour about the alleged Black Hand was JUDGE MAY We are really getting a very long way from this case particularly talking about rumour and the like Now can we move on to something which is more relevant THE ACCUSED Interpretation I refer to rumours because the witness spoke about them Now let us go on MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q You knew people who were in top positions in Pec Were there many Albanians in top positions in Pec A From the time when you came into power you could number them on the fingers of your hand Q All right Im asking you from that period onwards and not only from;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
that period onwards Im asking you about and do you know Albanians in Pec who were in top positions who held various offices in government in Pec Just say yes or no in order to save time A In this period I dont know of anybody who had a significant position in Peja Q Have you heard of the name of Xhafer Gjuka Page A Yes He was my physical education teacher at grammar school in Peja Metohija Q Was he head of social services in the municipality of Pec and also later on a member of the provisional council of Kosovo and A I didnt know about Xhafer Gjukas position but I know that he was involved in a party called JUL or something like that but I dont know what his position was Q He was a member of the leadership of the Yugoslav left but he held these positions So you do not know that he was a member of the provisional council and also that he was head of social services in Pec A I didnt know that Q And do you know of another Albanian Deme Muhaj who was deputy head of state security in Pec Do you know him A I knew him as a person but youve got his surname wrong Its not Muhaj but Mujaj von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Q Im not quite certain when I read an Albanian name whether Ive pronounced it accurately but its important;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
that we have identified him Do you know of Shaqir Nikqi Shaqir Nikqi who was a misdemeanours judge A No I didnt know him This is the first time Ive heard his in Pec name Q And do you know Mazllum Avdyli Who is Mazllum Avdyli A I dont remember him Page Q Principal of the school in Pec And do you know who is Rizah Demaj principal of the primary school A Tell me which primary school because I dont remember this name Q The primary school in Rogovo near Pec A No I dont remember him I dont know him Q Since you were involved in business you probably know the name of Fatmir Gashi He was deputy director of the SDK the public accounting service in Pec A Yes I know Fatmir Gashi personally He was a colleague of mine when we worked in the bank And there was not only Fatmir but there were many others in the social accounting service Q Also Albanians right A I dont understand this comment JUDGE MAY Just a moment What is the relevance of all this What this witness said in his evidence and the significance of it is that he was director of a coach company the coaches of which were taken from him and used the Prosecution say to deport refugees and that he was himself in March of when he was in Pec he was there when there was shelling and he left in his family;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
car and went to Montenegro Now thats what his evidence is about Youre trying to extend it to matters which seem to me speaking for myself to be totally irrelevant Whats the relevance of the fact that even if so that there may have been some Albanians in some positions in Pec at the time THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well the relevance is in the fact Page that the witness has been claiming that Albanians were in high positions earlier on and that later on their number was a singledigit one And then also he said just before the war in there werent any in von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm high positions that he knew of I have here a list of a great many Albanians who held very significant positions in Pec He was a director of a company Pec is not New York City so he would have to know all these Albanians The question has to do with the credibility of his statement When the witness says that there werent any Albanians in high positions and when he is shown these facts he would have to admit that because it was not a singledigit number it was a doubledigit number and even more than that including one Albanian as you heard who was a member of the government Thats very important here because the impression is being created that the Albanians had no rights whatsoever And we see here that in a big town Pec;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
a large number of Albanians held very important positions public offices administrative jobs et cetera That is why it is relevant If you claim that all of this is irrelevant well  JUDGE MAY Even if you were right about that this Court is concerned with displacement and killings in Now some evidence of events before then may of course be relevant but these seem to me matters of not a great deal of significance and a lot of the Courts time is being taken up with them the case of the last witness and now here again with this one If youve got something to challenge about what the witness said happened in his statement then you should put it THE ACCUSED Interpretation I think that the relevance of these Page questions is also in the fact that these facts fully bring under a question mark the stories about deportations because these persons in high positions  I mean had there been any deportations these persons in high offices would have had to be engaged involved in these deportations because they held such important positions And who would believe that that Albanians who are part of government in a municipality would organise deportations of Albanians even if it were to be assumed that the Serbs wanted to do that which is also not true JUDGE MAY Do you challenge the way in which this witness has given an account of leaving for Macedonia If so you should put it;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
And do you challenge that his vehicles were sequestrated Do you challenge that If so you should put it to him Thats the matters with which he can deal and those are the matters which are relevant THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well isnt it clear that Im von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm challenging it And I hope that if you carefully read both of his witness statements you will also be perfectly clear that his very statements challenge that But well show that Please just tell me how far time youre giving me for this witness so that I could cut my questions short because obviously I will not be in a position to put all the questions I have for him JUDGE MAY You have the usual time for the witness and so far youve taken up I should think minutes of it THE ACCUSED Interpretation All right So I have another minutes for him JUDGE MAY Something of that order yes Page THE ACCUSED Interpretation All right That is to say until MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Then I shall briefly scan all of this and then youre going to tell me whether you know any of these people Do you know the names of Skender Nuro director of the company called Zitopromet Besim Haska deputy head of the sales inspection in the district Muhammed Corkadiu who was president of the municipality of Pec and then head of the planning and analysis department in Pec Skender Hajdini;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
head of the personnel department in Pec that is to say the person who admitted officials for work and released them Dr Drita who was head of a ward Fatmir Kurmehaj also a director of the hospital  JUDGE MAY Stop Mr Zatriqi what is being suggested is that there were Albanians who were in important positions in Pec Now can you help us about that or not THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes All the names mentioned by the accused are people known to me but I must say these positions cannot be compared with the position of Fatmir Gashi who is an able economist There was no way of comparing this with the position of Xhafer Gjuka because these are absolute opposites And I dont know much about the inner workings of the municipality because I didnt have much dealings with it MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q I dont understand the explanation of these opposites Xhafer von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts Gjuka isnt he an Albanian too A Xhafer Gjuka is an Albanian Page Q He was a member of the provisional government of Kosovo So why would this be in opposition to the other Albanian who was director of the SDK A I wasnt aware of Xhafer Gjukas position but I didnt know he had such a high position I knew him as a deputy director in the public accounting service Q All;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
right Tell me then all these Albanians whose names Ive read out to you did you know all of them von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm A Not all of them Some of them I did know but as citizens of Peja as faces Some of them I knew Q Are you trying to say that you didnt know what they did You dont know what positions they held Is that your assertion A No I didnt know what jobs they had Q All right I dont want to waste much time Im just going to read ten more names of Albanians to you so that you tell me whether you know them Dr Midhat Jakupi head of the orthopaedics department of the city hospital Ojdaj phoen Pepa the secretary of  THE INTERPRETER Could the speaker please slow down for the interpreters JUDGE MAY Slow down please MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Adem Grapci municipal  Judge of the municipal court in Pec Shaban Ukaj coordinator for education in Pec Claims were always made Page that Albanians were not being educated but even the head of education in Pec was an Albanian Sali Dionka director of the cooperative in Kucica Not to mention all of them There are five directors of cooperatives in villages around Pec and all of them are Albanians At the head of the military department in Pec was also an Albanian That is to say the lists of military conscripts callup papers were sent;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
by Hatixhe Berisha Ekrem Zara inspector  JUDGE MAY Enough The witness cannot begin to take all this in THE ACCUSED Interpretation I am asking him  JUDGE MAY Mr Zatriqi youve been asked about a list of names Can you help about those or not THE WITNESS Interpretation Some of them I know but I cant know who was in what position For instance manager of a cooperative I was involved in transport and had nothing to do with agriculture And he could read out a lot of other names but I wouldnt know what positions they had MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q All right Do you know of Hatixhe Berisha at least the military department in Pec That is to say military conscripts their lists callup polices for the army et cetera He was an ethnic Albanian Do von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm you know of that Defence A No I dont know anything about him I completed my military service a long time ago and I dont know anything about All Peoples Page Q All right You were involved in transportation Do you know the name of Fetih Hoti and Ekrem Zara Both of them worked precisely as inspectors for transportation in the municipality of Pec That is to say your own line of work Also Albanians A Yes I know him personally And I know that his authorities were very restricted He had been inspector for years And there was another inspector called Antic;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
And Fetih Hoti had very limited responsibilities Q All right As far as responsibilities are concerned thats a very relative question I cant really read all this out to you because it would be pointless but so far I have read out at least names to you or rather positions that were held by Albanians Doesnt it seem to you that with that structure of positions that were held by Albanians some government can be involved in the organisation of deportations of Albanians from Pec JUDGE MAY Its not a matter for the witness Its a matter that well have to decide MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Do you remember that in the villages around Pec there were local policemen precisely in Albanian villages that were elected by the citizens themselves the local villagers and who held these positions of local policemen who wore uniforms and who carried weapons They were selected by the villagers in those respective villages Do you remember that A No I do not remember this because in Peja and its environs I have never come across an Albanian policeman and Ive had contacts with Page Q And do you remember the name of Haxha Berisha from the village of loads of people Krusevac A No I cannot remember this name Q He was a local policeman an Albanian in the village of Krusevac von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm And what about Gaci Kelmendi Have you heard of that name A No I have;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
not heard of any name of anybody who as you allege was a policeman Q He was in the village of Kosoric What about the name of Bushataj Bushataj a local policeman for the Llubeniq and Rausic villages which are right by Pec He was killed by members of the KLA precisely because he was a policeman Do you know of that event A No I havent heard of that Q What about a policeman named Nikoliqi for the Dragovan Milovanic and Pocesje villages Do you know about that A No I have not known him And as you very well know I lived in Peja and during I did not go through these villages in particular These names are not known to me Q As you were just in Pec do you know of a single Serb civilian a policeman or soldier during this period of time lets say October and the th of March was killed or abducted by the KLA from the Pec area A No I havent heard I havent heard of that at all Q Have you heard of the KLA at all Did you hear of it while you were in Pec at all A Yes a lot and I am proud of it Page Q All right Youve given your answer Now do you know about the killing  the killing of children in the Panda Bar in Pec A boy was killed He was  boys were killed the ages of to;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

having for lunch is cooking for lunch let alone when somebody kills somebody JUDGE MAY Is that true of Pec or Peja THE WITNESS Interpretation No thats not true at all because Peja is not as small a place as the accused is trying to portray it In addition to that we must take into account the restricted movement and the impossibility of having information on everything that is being alleged here MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation events occurred Is that right Q You claim that there was restricted movement in Pec when these A Yes That is true We  our movement was always restricted to three to four hours per day The rest of the days we stayed indoors At a certain point in time we were even unable to venture onto the balcony of my own house because one of our neighbours advised me to stay indoors given that snipers were positioned all around and they could put my life in danger Therefore I can assert here that our movements were extremely restricted Q So your movements were restricted by the fact that your neighbour told you that it was dangerous not through somebody actually having prevented you from moving around is that correct Have I understood you correctly Yes or no A No I think you got me wrong What I said  I said that in Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm addition to our movements being curtailed we were even unable to venture;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
onto the roofs and balconies of our own houses because of the snipers Q That of course is not true But tell me please Who restricted your movements How were your movements restricted and curtailed A It is true that nobody came to me personally to tell me that you cannot go out into the city and so on but the fact of mysterious killings is reason enough for citizens to curtail their own movements i e to get out when in desperate need and not on every single occasion Q All right My question was Did anybody restrict your movements by issuing an order of any kind or decree of any kind and your answer was no Lets move on not to lose time Have you heard of an Albanian by the name of Berisha Zymber A No I havent heard Q So you dont know that he was killed A Yes Q And do you know that the press radio and television made public all these killings in Pec You had a local radio station and were able to watch Radio Television Serbias programmes as well and Pristinas programmes and so on So does that mean that you werent kept abreast with the information media A Im certainly not  I did not follow the information disseminated by this media instilled in Peja As you very well know we used to follow other programmes beamed through satellite and so on Q So you just followed the television programmes;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
and radio Page programmes coming from Albania and the Western media is that it A The programmes from Albania very very little but it was mostly CNN and EuroNews and other programmes broadcast from Europe because that is where we were able to get the truth from to find out what was happening in our vicinity Q So through EuroNews you got to know what was in fact going on in the town in which you lived is that what youre saying A I was not referring to my own city only but to Kosova at large These were the programmes which we used to listen to And I mentioned other outlets as well if I recall correctly Q All right Via EuroNews and the other media So you claim that von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm you knew nothing about what was going on in your own town is that it A I didnt say I didnt know anything I only replied to the questions on the names that you put to me and what I said is that I had no knowledge I hadnt heard of any programme that would have broadcast the incidents that you mentioned here Q And have you heard of an Albanian called Kuci Skender Kutsi phoen or Kuci phoen Im not sure how you pronounce the name but it was Kuci or Kuci Skender A No I dont know this name Q What about another Albanian Adem  or two Albanians;0;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

Interpretation Yes They were the ones to give me this account because I knew not only the witnesses but also the Gjuka brothers and their families so I spoke to their families and to the Page witnesses MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q You therefore claim that they were not killed by KLA members You say that the policemen took them off somewhere and massacred them and threw their bodies away Is that your story A Yes This is the truth Q All right Thats quite sufficient by way of an answer von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Do you know who Nuredin Zejnullahu was Zejnullahi or llahu Zejnullah Nuredin A Yes He was a medical doctor I have known him very well His murder also shook the city of Peja  rather shocked Q Yes And his daughter was injured on the occasion slightly He was killed by the KLA at his very threshold Is that correct or not A Youre wrong here He was killed by masked people on the threshold of his house They spoke Serbian and I know this very well Your assertion that the KLA killed him holds no water Q Well do you know that there was a whole investigation with evidence as to what had happened It shocked everybody He was killed because he worked in the hospital because he worked like a normal citizen of Serbia doing his job at his workplace The whole country knows about A Yes thats how it;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

deported in my buses Q Very well THE ACCUSED Interpretation I have no further questions JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Tapuskovic MR TAPUSKOVIC Interpretation I am just going to dwell on a few things that Mr Zatriqi said Questioned by Mr Tapuskovic Q Interpretation You already said that on the th you were deported Thats what you said just now that you were deported from Kosovo You said here something about the th Im interested in the th The th of March you spent it in the basement On the th there was the shelling that you spoke of but you were in the basement on the th On the th Could you explain this I have to say one thing I know that on that day indeed all of Yugoslavia was in basements and cellars but why were you in the cellar all day on the th A The night of the th from Friday to Saturday was the most difficult night for me and my family We spent it there because there was a lot of movement of the police and the army in my neighbourhood And Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm English transcripts Page especially there had been tanks situated in the hospital yard and schoolyard which you could see from my window And at about in the morning about ten metres away from my house because I was watching this tank ;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
my family was in the cellar I wasnt  but a green van came out and about eight armed police got out and they started to shoot at my house They broke the windows and various bits of the house and then they pointed their barrels down and they started running And I thought that they were going to kill my family But fortunately nothing happened But then on the Saturday morning  I must mention that the van that had stopped in front of my house and from which the police had got out and mercilessly shot at my house that van around about in the morning when I had gone to the back of the house I saw this same van parked in the yard of my neighbours who were Serb Q Mr Zatriqi you did not mention a word of any of this earlier on Earlier on you just said that on the th shooting started in the neighbourhood of Kapeshnica and that thats what you saw with your own eyes Thats what you said then But what you are talking about today you never mentioned before You also said that on the th you saw people moving about and you say that you didnt know what was happening Is that true A Thats right On the th of March I saw how the Kapeshnica neighbourhood was being shelled This event that happened during the von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm night in my house;1;2;Edison Zatriqi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

I became a district court judge It is a fact Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts Page that I was one of the youngest judges At the same time there were two of my colleagues who graduated at the same time and were of the same age and were accepted at the district court Q You say at the beginning of your written statement At the beginning of I became a judge at the district court in Mitrovica When I was given permission to retire I ended my career as a judge in and then in I opened my own law office  and so on and so forth Why did you retire that early in practically three years after you became a district court judge in Kosovska Mitrovica In You were born in is that right von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm A I did not resign I did not forward any application But I had a request to be dismissed from the job of the judge because I wanted to practice as a defence lawyer Q You say that you were granted retirement by having submitted an application So were you retired as a judge of the district court and did you then become a defence lawyer Yes No A No that is not correct I forwarded an application to be discharged and with the expiry of the threemonth period;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
And if the assembly which has appointed the judge does not take a decision on it with the expiry of the threemonth period his mandate comes to an end and that was the procedure that was applied in my own case Q Im asking you because it says here in your own statement that your own request was granted your request for retirement So what it says here in the statement is an inaccurate interpretation of what you said Thats the way I understand it now Right Page A It may be a misinterpretation resulting from the translation from English into Albanian or the Serbian The truth is as I mentioned it Q All right You said in your statement that as for the interests of your clients you could have them realised only through money Is that earlier correct A Yes that is correct in the majority of cases Q That means that as a former judge first of the municipal court and then of the district court and then as a lawyer as an attorney with that kind of career that you were involved in bribery JUDGE MAY I dont follow that Whats the point Whats the question Mr Milosevic Whats the question THE ACCUSED Interpretation First of all I asked in relation to the witnesss statement  how did he put it here The interests of his clients he had them fulfilled through money And I asked him whether thats correct and he said that it is;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
correct And the question  JUDGE MAY Perhaps we had better get an explanation of the answer what that means Now can you help us Mr Halimi  Just a moment Well have it clarified Mr Halimi can you help us What is the position here What is von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm being said is that you were involved in bribery Now can you help us with that THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes Let me explain very briefly During the time of Milosevics regime in Kosovo justice in Kosovo was Page bought and sold It was to be paid for MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q So as a lawyer as an attorney you were involved in bribery is that right A The only way to secure freedom somebodys freedom  it was the only way to secure the freedom of my clients Q A short while ago you pointed out that thats the way it was during the Milosevic regime However you became an attorney a lawyer in or the beginning of Is that contradictory to what youve been saying A These words that you quoted I was thinking of the s I wasnt thinking of JUDGE ROBINSON Mr Milosevic let me ask the witness a question Im afraid Im not understanding this whole matter of bribery and in particular of the witnesss personal involvement as a lawyer in bribery Can you give us a practical example of how you were involved in this buying of the freedom;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
of your clients Give us a practical example because its not clear to me at all THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes It was and there was a person accused of a large quantity of weapons which under the chief examination in the Mitrovica district court the accusation remained concerning three guns And for this he was sentenced to two years imprisonment And to lessen the sentence in the Serbian Supreme Court Page you had to find a connection and marks were paid and my client was left with a reduced sentence of one years imprisonment while for one gun a long one that is an automatic weapon or a military gun the Mitrovica communal court and other courts would pronounce minimum sentences of six to eight months And I think this says a lot Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Well return to this after the adjournment Its time von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm to adjourn now until half past Mr Halimi would you remember in this adjournment and any others there may be not to speak to anybody about your evidence until its over  Luncheon recess taken at p m  On resuming at p m Page JUDGE ROBINSON Mr Halimi before the adjournment you were telling us about the practice of the  in relation to the inference of money in the judicial system What Id like to find out is just how widespread was that practice of bribery THE WITNESS Interpretation I can freely say;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
that this practice especially from onwards until the end of was an open secret known to every single citizen of Kosova JUDGE ROBINSON And you yourself participated in this practice THE WITNESS Interpretation In my previous statement when I mentioned a case in response to a question from the accused I said Deutschmarks were given and this was confirmed by the brother of my own client and I can responsibly assert here before Your Honours that in my whole life in my whole career as a defence lawyer it only occurred once to me that I had to produce a thousand Deutschmarks to have something done that related to me and the rest Ive heard from other people JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Milosevic MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Q Well lets continue with that then In view of the fact that in your statement you explained in very clear terms that this was the practice or rather that that was the practice you engaged in are you now withdrawing that statement that you previously made by saying that you only did it once Are you retracting that or do you stand by your statement and said that you had to do your job through money with the help of money as you said in your statement Page A It appears you have not understood the answer correctly so let me clarify and this will be crystal clear I said regarding especially the period from;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
to Serbian justice which decided the fate of the Albanians all where the life of Albanians was at issue meant  and weve often commented with my own colleagues wed often say that Serbian justice is on the point of being sold as a commodity on the market Q I think that regardless of the harsh terms used that you cant retract what you said in your statement Let me quote It is on page at the beginning of the page the first paragraph on that page Ill jump over the unimportant things although I can take it from the beginning I had to find hundreds of ways to keep good relations with the Serb authorities in Mitrovica I always had to act in the interests of my clients and the most difficult moments in my professional work was when I realised that nothing but money was the reality It happened unfortunately rather often I had some difficult times when I had to go back to my clients and tell them that they had to pay because Serb justice was only valid if they were ready to pay  Therefore your qualifications of Serb justice  well come to that later on  but from what I have read out is it clear to you and everybody following these proceedings that you state unfortunately and you do use the word unfortunately  it happened rather often  Therefore we absolutely cannot accept whether Im right or not what you said;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
happened to you just once Because you werent answering my question you were answering Judge Robinsons question and said you gave Deutschmarks to reduce the sentence for one client He asked you Page about one case You told him of one case and one example whereas here in your statement you said It happened unfortunately rather often  And then you go on to say I had some difficult times  et cetera but it did von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm happen rather often Now my question is You engaged in bribery Is that correct or not A I can say partially yes I had to That was the only way to sort out the future for my own client JUDGE MAY The point which is being made is that you say in your statement It happened unfortunately rather often  And what youre telling us was that it happened once Now can you explain the discrepancy THE WITNESS Interpretation When I explain those cases I can probably dwell on this issue for about four hours on end However let me reiterate that in the majority of cases  and let me say in the Supreme Court in the District Court throughout Serbia where Ive been defending various parties in the Supreme Court being a court of the second instance and not only me but also my own Albanian colleagues have seen people before those courts the Supreme Court of Serbia and we had to defend ;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
and we had to defend our own clients Technical personnel of that very same court were in charge of the procedure on certain matters and the wheelerdealer of that same court approached me personally asking me to give money if I were to sort out the fate of my own client and that is the message that I conveyed to the family of the client I told them who they had to go to to sort that out JUDGE MAY You explained that But did this happen once or more than once Page THE WITNESS Interpretation I said I myself only once did I have to produce out of my own pocket a thousand Deutschmarks JUDGE MAY You also say in your statement Only in political cases it was not possible to use bribes  Is that right THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes that is correct Because state security whose members were a party to this procedure were under strict control of state security and thats why the situation was different It was not possible there to pay bribes to have  to release someone who had been convicted on politicallymotivated charges JUDGE MAY Yes MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Therefore you engaged in bribery yes or no A I think I gave an answer to this I dont think I have to reply von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm twice to the same question Q Well the answer is quite obvious Now did I understand you correctly As you;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
yourself said here you frequently gave money and once you even gave money out of your own pocket Now as youre a lawyer yourself is it clear to you that it doesnt make any difference whether you gave out your own money or your clients money in a criminal  in the criminal act of bribery A Im fully aware and especially if youre aware of the institution of extreme need that is when in order to save the future of the freedom of somebody that in itself is prioritarian sic compared to the money Q Every criminal when he perpetrates a crime gives that same Page Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Page explanation that he had to do it in order to achieve a certain goal a certain end Now are you conscious of the fact that the difference between what must necessarily be done and what is done in a legal manner and what must be done and is committed against the law means the difference between a crime and an honest affair JUDGE MAY I dont follow the question I suppose it could be Did you think what you were doing when bribes were paid or THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes all the time and I felt very rephrased in this way arranged was dishonest bad about it JUDGE MAY And then you can tell us why you did it nonetheless THE;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
WITNESS Interpretation Your Honour I said the freedom of a person is sacred People were being charged with no evidence at all simply out of ethnicity When the law on weapons and munitions was passed if Im not wrong in the only applicable venue was Kosova and it was only meant and applied against the Albanians JUDGE ROBINSON If they were being charged as a result of their ethnicity would that fall into the category of political cases that you said formed the only exception to this practice of bribery THE WITNESS Interpretation A criminal political offence I can freely say here wasnt constituted actually The ultimate aim of the Milosevic regime  and the munitions and the weapons bill was part of it  the Albanians when the police charged someone with arms possession an Albanian had to go and try and buy a weapon somewhere in order to show it to the police or otherwise suffer the consequences and be abused on a Page daily basis by the police JUDGE MAY Yes MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q Is it clear to you that by quoting the example you picked at random in response to the question posed by Judge Robinson that you in fact put forward the example of your client who was accused of possessing large quantities of weapons in fact Now was he being charged for possessing large quantities of weapons under the circumstances that prevailed in Kosovo and is it clear to you that that too;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
must necessarily von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm have been considered as having a political background being in possession of large quantities of weapons So not pistols or hunting rifles or something that someone might buy from someone else but large quantities of weapons in Kosovo How then if you could not  if nothing could be done about things of that kind you were successful in bribing the people Or perhaps what you said to begin with wasnt true that is to say that in political crimes you were not able to bribe anyone So what is the truth A Forgive me I did not understand this question JUDGE MAY Try and put the question more shortly MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q You said when quoting the example for Judge Robinson that your client was accused of being in possession of large quantities of weapons Thats right isnt it A Yes Page Q Now what is the punishment the sentence for being caught in possession of large quantities of weapons according to the law What would the sentence for that kind of crime be A According to provisions of Article paragraph subitem of the bill on weapons and munitions as it was called at that time it was possible to sentence someone to up to years in gaol for possession of over three weapons Q And that means that your client although you said that Albanians were unjustly taken to court when he possessed large quantities of weapons;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
he was sentenced to a fifth of that maximum prison sentence because you said three years he got three years Is that right A Yes because I paid with my own money  his own money Q No You said that he was sentenced to three and then those three years by giving bribes you were able to reduce to one year Thats what you said Court A It seems you didnt understand my answer or this is your personal view It was two years and it was reduced to one year by the Supreme JUDGE MAY That in fact was what he said earlier MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q So the prison sentence was two years and it was reduced to one von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm year because you paid is that it A Because the client paid not myself Q All right Because the client paid through you is that right A Not through me no I showed him the connection I said Go to Page the entrance of the Supreme Court and go to suchandsuch a person  Q All right You organised this transaction of bribery for him Now as you said that you did this because of the ultimate goal of freedom because freedom was inviolable did you consider when this client of yours was sentenced to two years you say for a criminal act of being in possession of a large quantity of arms when he could have got years you;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
say that he was unjustly sentenced when he just got an eighth of the prescribed maximum prison sentence for that crime A I mentioned the case in which justice was bought freedom was bought I only mentioned one case I could explain umpteen other cases I could talk for about four hours elaborating on this question Q All right During the many years you were in practice Im sure that you carried out this criminal act of bribery countless times Im not asking you to mention exactly how many times Im sure you couldnt do that letting him answer JUDGE MAY You cannot put things like that to a witness without Whats suggested is that you were involved in bribery countless times Mr Halimi Is that true or not THE WITNESS Interpretation As I said so it is and there was no escaping it Because this is what the regime was like It was impossible to work in any other way in this regime MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q As a lawyer and a former judge are you aware of how much  the number the figures arent important but there were quite a considerable Page number of cases where people were held to account in courts of law  Judges and other lawyers  precisely for having committed the crime of bribery They were taken to court The type of crime that you have been speaking about here Are you aware of that A Yes When the regime sought to;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
cover its own traces it always managed to find such cases von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Q I dont know what this has to do with the regime and traces but as you are aware of this Do you know that for every report made of a judge receiving a bribe there was a very careful operation put into place by the investigating organs and do you know that in cases of that kind the money bills would be marked and that if those marked money bills were found on a judge they would serve as corpus delicti and the authorities did everything they could to eradicate bribery of this kind and that these cases were taken to court especially when it involved bribery in courts of law in legal proceedings A To tell the truth I dont know of such cases at least not in Kosova I know of nobody in the office of a judge being discharged for receiving bribes Ive never heard of such a case Q Well your answer is sufficient for me Now can you answer the following question A moment ago you said that you knew that people were taken to court for having received bribes Why did you not report a single case why did you not report a single individual who had in fact received bribes A Because I was working in the interests of my client Q Thank you for your answers for these answers of yours Im;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

unarmed civilians You have just told us that police did not attack unarmed civilians and this is the reason why they did not carry arms Isnt that so A I was referring to the care shown by the members of the KLA As concerns the behaviour of police and military forces as well as the paramilitaries and whatnot they showed no consideration at all towards anyone Q Yes but you have just explained that the KLA made a decision to go about unarmed in Donja Zhabare in order to avoid being pressured or attacked by the police and based on that I conclude that it was a fact that the police did not attack unarmed civilians Is that so or not JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Saxon MR SAXON Your Honour if I can simply clarify the record What the witness said in the English translation was that there were no KLA soldiers present in the village armed or unarmed but that two unarmed members of the KLA came to the village on that specific day to speak specifically to that witness Thank you JUDGE MAY Yes Thank you Yes Mr Milosevic The next question THE ACCUSED Interpretation I did not receive a reply to my previous question JUDGE MAY Its unnecessary It was a mere matter of comment MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Very well Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts Page Q When you were;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
leaving Prizren a soldier of the JNA told you at the time to be cautious when using lights because NATO could bomb you And did you mainly have your lights turned off after that A It was very dark th of April of It was approximately after in the evening It is true that upon leaving Prizren a soldier asked us to switch the lights off because of any eventual attacks by NATO but it was impossible to drive in this kind of darkness with no lights on at all so it was  it was necessary switch them on because it would have been impossible to drive otherwise and the car  the car that I was driving was not in a very good condition So what I had to do is switch the mediumrange lights and the back lights  rear lights rather Q And did the soldiers tell you as you were going along not to be von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm afraid and to take care not to go across any mines that had been planted A This happened on the th of April when we were crossing the border at Morina near Prizren We had stopped in front of the border crossing point at the building by the bridge on the AlbanianKosova border And they indicated by hand not to go on the left side of the road because five members of a family from Fushe Kosova had been hit by mines;1;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
from Fushe Kosova were killed and there were only fragments left of their own car Q Does that mean that they came across a mine Q Now why did you tell the group of intellectuals;1;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
why did you advise the group of intellectuals from Kosovska Mitrovica not to go to A Yes Montenegro A Because I knew that they would suffer the fate that I did I knew that they couldnt pass there without being detected by Serbian military forces I was with them They included Dr Adem Ademi and many other of my friends who are now missing Q And how many of them did you meet after everything had passed You said that there were about of them in the group as far as I recall Or how many How many were there in the group von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm A Of that group with whom I stayed there is not one of them left None of them are alive Page Q I understood you to say that several of them returned and a part of them are missing and that their whereabouts is not known A I dont know where they are They have disappeared while I myself and my friends Adem Nura a doctor in Mitrovica and the veteran Rilindja journalist and various other intellectuals decided two days previously to return to Zhabar and to Mitrovica that part of Tavnik where the situation was now quiet and they remained there and not one of them  not one of them has returned to their own homes They fell in an ambush somewhere Q And tell me this How many members of your own family  I dont;1;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
just mean your nearest family that is to say your wife and children but your broader family your relatives on your mothers side and so on  were members of the KLA A Not one because they are all abroad Q Lets go back to your statement now Im going to quote just one passage from that statement and it relates to your explanations as to how individual people who wore uniforms  you said soldiers  I believe I havent got the exact word now and then you say comma members of paramilitary forces  which is not the same thing is it  that they would take money that they would stop you and so on and so forth And then theres a paragraph after that from your statement which says the following They had already moved to the next two cars to loot them  And then this paragraph and it is on page as far as I can see and you say I saw that from the direction of Djakovica a white police vehicle was approaching us It was a Land Rover  Page It is one two three four the fourth paragraph From the direction of Djakovica I saw a white Land Rover a police car coming towards us When the paramilitaries saw the police car approaching us they immediately stopped their activities and jumped into their Opel Calibra and drove away very quickly The police car did not stop at us but continued towards;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
Prizren  Now from this paragraph is it clear that this banditry that youre talking about and those who took part in it who were fleeing from von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm the police shows two things actually First that they were not members of any  forces of any kind but just ordinary bandits who were afraid of the police and second that the police was in pursuit of bandits of that kind And is that the conclusion that you as a lawyer and a previous judge onetime judge can draw from that paragraph A First from the uppermost level to the lowest level of the military police structure you can say that it was all coordinated minutely If those policemen had wanted to fight crime and the looting of the populous  now I remember because it was an Opel Calibra I remember that these paramilitaries had very very long rifles There was one more  I was the second the third in line and the police approached us And then this Land Rover came and passed close by If the police had wished to help they could have done They saw what happened But they only parked and observed at a distance of metres And this was a village near Prizren more or less the final village before the entrance into Prizren Q Well youre now saying something quite different From what I Page just quoted reading from your statement the members of what;0;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002
you refer to as paramilitaries who according to what you say went on looting when they saw that from the direction of Djakovica a white police car was approaching a Land Rover in fact went off very quickly And you say that the police car didnt even stop by us but continued along the road to Prizren  So they saw a police car they fled from the police and the others went past Now you say that the police stopped at the parking lot and watched you being mistreated This is quite the opposite of what you yourself wrote down here in the statement Is that clear or not A You asked me to comment on that and I did that Why didnt the police go and chase the car with the people who looted other people But it continued on its way Q How do you know How do you know they didnt go that way Thats the direction the car took fleeing in the face of the police vehicle Thats what you yourself say in your statement here A No I didnt say that I said the two cars passed one another The car that did the looting went in the direction of Gjakove whilst the car that came from Gjakove headed towards Prizren Q Thats not what you said No It says here  von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm JUDGE MAY No I think weve exhausted this topic We can see whats said;1;2;Mahmut Halimi;020425IT;IT-02-54;25.04.2002

by Mr Milosevic Q Interpretation Mrs Hajrizi in view of this immense tragic loss that befell you I shall restrict my questions to very few The most necessary ones only really In your statement on page in paragraphs and you say  actually Im just going to read out a small section It took me about ten minutes to reach the meeting point  This took place after this tragic event You went to  well you say anyway It took me about minutes to reach the meeting point The Serb soldiers did not harm me but sometimes I had to wait and hide to let them pass  This is already your feeling but the core of the matter is The Serb soldiers did not harm me  In the next paragraph you speak about your brother who came to pick you up in his taxi and towards the end of this paragraph you say About ten metres away  this is approximately the distance between you and me now About ten metres away there were some policemen but they did not harm us  So the soldiers and the policemen according to your own description behaved normally None of them did you any harm And according to the description of events that you gave  because its tragic you lost your son your husband your motherinlaw  is it clear Page that this was done by criminals that this was not done by any military or police unit;0;2;Aferdita Hajrizi;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
A Your first question is not clear to me Can you please repeat von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm it And then I will answer about the other question about taking  me taking ten minutes Im not clear what you want to get  where you want to get at Q That is not important I was quoting the text of your statement I can skip that sentence altogether Thats the way the paragraph starts so I read it in order to identify the paragraph The point is The Serb soldiers did not harm me  That is what it says in the third paragraph And in the fourth paragraph it says About ten metres away there were some policemen but they did not harm us  So here you speak both about soldiers and about policemen who did not harm you at all Bearing that in mind since I assume  JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Saxon MR SAXON Just to be sure that this is clear for the witness Mr Milosevic is referring to the witnesss second statement from  JUDGE MAY Yes Yes Lets try and deal with it this way so that the witness can follow Just one moment What is being suggested as I understand it is this Is that the soldiers and police did not harm you when you were leaving the scene Is that right THE WITNESS Interpretation What the accused is saying that is utopia The fact that we were;0;2;Aferdita Hajrizi;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
harassed and attacked in our own home as Page innocent citizens we were the fact that a child only yearold an old woman years old who had done nobody any harm and was not responsible for what happened in Kosova for the genocide perpetrated against our people that shows that Serb police did not come there to save us to spare us JUDGE MAY Let me interrupt The point that is made whether you agree with it or not is that in the statement it says that they didnt harm you This was after the murders which had taken place And what is suggested to you  and perhaps this is the point of the question  is that this was not a police or a military unit which committed the murders What is being said and suggested is that it was criminals of some sort who did it Can you say who they were Now can you identify those who were responsible for the murders von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes In my full responsibility I can identify the perpetrators because ten minutes before the crime was committed my husband recognised them very well because we saw in front of our door two black vehicles parked and we saw six offspring of Milosevic inside the cars Two were at the wheel and six others came out in the yard My husband recognised four of them Nenad Pavicevic our neighbour nextdoor neighbour then Dejan;1;2;Aferdita Hajrizi;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002

a hard time to our families They are killing people for no reason  And they said that Arkan will do short work of Milosevic and will replace him in the longrun That was the crux of the conversation It was longer of course but it took two hours It will take me several days to tell you every and each of the words we said After they left they  the police didnt stop them They escorted us up to Stedine village where the truck was waiting There was also metres of cloth for uniforms There were some mortars millimetres and a large quantity of bullets Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English transcripts bullets sniper rifles Kalashnikovs They escorted me up to the place and then I took them to our Page position in Kacanoll Q How many of them were there A Four There was a driver with a truck There was another person And I was accompanied with three other people We had our car and no police roadblocks check blocks gave us any hard time because those Serbs had the proper authorisation and nobody dared stop them on Q And it is your assertion that these were some of Arkans men the way A Yes Q On the basis of what you talked to with them was it your conclusion that they were with him or against him A They were;1;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
with Arkan against yourself They said that the only person important in Serbia is Arkan who keeps his family in Serbia who fights with his family whereas the others stay in power while their families are in safe places abroad Q So they were on his side against me That is your assertion A That was their assertion not mine Q Tell me do you know that my family was in Yugoslavia throughout von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm and that they were not anywhere abroad JUDGE MAY Were getting far from the indictment now THE ACCUSED Interpretation Hes talking about an assertion JUDGE MAY Yes Hes describing a conversation Now lets move on THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well I doubt that explanation but Page Q Were you personally issued with some kind of a weapon Did you we can go on MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation have a personal weapon of your own A Yes Q What kind of weapon did you have A Up to the time I was engaged in supplying in logistics I didnt need a weapon I just had a stick a baton But when I joined the army after the NATO airstrikes again and your army started their attacks I also got a weapon I had a Skorpion THE INTERPRETER The interpreter corrects herself MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q What kind of weapon did you have exactly A You are asking me to tell you what weapon I had Q Yes A It is my own;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002

for a far longer period than normal in view of the evidence this witness can give as well as the conciseness of the accuseds questioning which obviously is of importance when he is questioning witnesses JUDGE MAY Yes Well consider that Trial Chamber confers expect you to finish by MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation JUDGE MAY Yes we will extend the time Mr Milosevic we Page Q Before I continue could you please tell me when this event occurred exactly the event you just described when you bought a truckload of weapons from these persons from those four men you mentioned Medvedja on A This was about January February  I dont remember exactly  in Q In January or February A I dont remember exactly because I was on a lot of tours and I dont remember which one I also have the fax to bring the shipment to Q And did you make this institution aware of that fax We can go Do you know how many armed persons the KLA had in A No It was not for me to know My job was merely to supply food Q If you say no lets just save time You say that it was only up to you to supply them with food right von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm A Yes well Q A little while ago you said that you supplied them with weapons as A Everything weapons food vehicles and whatever I could whatever kind of;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
goods I could buy for the KLA Whenever I had the opportunity I bought things and sent them as did all of my group For instance there was Ahmed Ajeti who was a mechanic in Podujeva and he worked as a mechanic servicing your vehicles and they sent him weapons saying that we were sending him vehicles And that was one supply route Page And round about when the war in Croatia started I had my own business and they asked me  people who wanted to desert from the army when the war in Croatia started they  and I sent them civilian clothes And they left their weapons there and I collected those weapons and used them That was in during the war in Bosnia There was only one case in which there were desertees who came with their weapons and I gave them aid  JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Ryneveld MR RYNEVELD Your Honour I realise this is highly unusual but a highly unusual situation has just arisen The witness has been asked about documentation about this particular matter about the selling of arms et cetera et cetera Not included in his statement not included in the attachments the witness has brought a document with him to this session which is provided to us which is not properly something that we could submit as far as the bis Normally I would reexamine on this document but perhaps it is important that this document get distributed so that;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
the accused has an opportunity to deal with the matter since its arisen during crossexamination I just thought I should bring this to the attention of the Court and the accused in fairness to everyone JUDGE MAY Yes MR RYNEVELD Because if I were to wait until reexamination I wonder whether that would be appropriate JUDGE MAY Yes Lets put it on the ELMO and well have a look at it MR RYNEVELD Again Im unable to assist in terms of what it says but I know it relates to the subject matter presently under Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm discussion JUDGE MAY Mr Aliu would you look at that Is that the document you were referring to THE WITNESS Interpretation Yes MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation It says here As read    thats a machinegun calibre  can be provided three pieces Price Deutschmark  Then it says Both types of rifles  I dont know what this refers to  for the time being pieces according to the agreed price  And then it says Munitions for a millimetre machinegun about pieces two Deutschmarks per piece Munitions  this is a bit deleted  for rifles millimetres will be prepared about pieces According to plan these major goods will be taken care of by the end of the month because all of this cannot be obtained and placed in a safe place and cannot be carried out before additional activity on a truck for;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
transportation  And then theres something deleted I cant see this This seems illegible I cant see whether it says Malisheva or Mitrovica  but in the original you can probably see what it says It starts with a capital letter so I assume that it is the name of a town So That version is acceptable  it says And then it says For you personally you will get a gift a Heckler millimetres automatic  Could you please lift the page further up A bit further up A bit more It should only be confirmed as soon as possible in order to have yet another shipment taken care of Plastic explosives and Page those ignition fuses  I cant read this Could you please put it up JUDGE MAY Previous translation continues MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Main I cant read this The main  and theres another word At least kilogrammes and then kilogrammes Agrees to return to warehouse so that then all these other goods could be paid for in a deferred way  I imagine hes referring to deferred payments  for transportation by truck I would have to  I cant see this properly on this monitor  get this Get this He mentions a telegram When I tell you that we should talk  Sunday It says on Sunday up here Sunday telegram This Sunday we should talk  And thats the end of this page Q So this is your communication in writing with;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002

and it can be translated in due course MR RYNEVELD Yes The other thing I should note is that it appears to be a fax with a date of March th which is barely legible would not show up but that is the top righthand corner on the fax JUDGE MAY Yes Thank you Let it be exhibited let it have a number and let the accused see it If you exhibit it  THE REGISTRAR Yes Your Honours It will be Exhibit ter MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Yes you can see now that it says Medvedja  because on the screen it could not be read Thats right It says Medvedja  th of March at past judging by the fax Yes Oh I thought this was an original This is a fax But obviously you know who you were communicating with Q Is that right or is that not right THE ACCUSED Interpretation Thank you Mr Usher You can take this Page JUDGE MAY Did you know who it came from is the question A Yes we knew from the people who supplied us but the names are  JUDGE MAY Very well THE INTERPRETER The interpreter asks the witness to move closer to the microphone MR MILOSEVIC Interpretation Q So that means that you can identify the perpetrators of this von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm crime JUDGE MAY He said that for security reasons he does not want to give the names and I for;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
one would support that answer THE ACCUSED Interpretation Yes but he is dutybound to give those names JUDGE MAY Not necessarily Well discuss it THE ACCUSED Interpretation This is  JUDGE MAY Just a moment Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Kay What is the evidential value anyway MR KAY If it is of evidential value and it may be perhaps the names could be written down on a piece of paper kept under seal disclosed to the accused in the usual way and then he may reflect upon whether he needs to use the names or not and the names can be protected JUDGE ROBINSON I think I would need to be assured of the evidential value because there is a clear possibility of prejudice MR KAY It may be contrary to the interests of these Page individuals but it may be prejudicial to the defence of the accused if he doesnt have the information which is why I suggest perhaps it can go under seal which means that its a document thats protected from the public eyes and it can be considered JUDGE MAY What evidential value could it have It could put them in danger Thats the point MR KAY As yet I dont know we dont know because we dont know if the names are of any significance or not but if the information is kept in a protected form  this Court is well used to dealing with protections for the Prosecution in relation;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
to information in their case In our submission the same criteria should be applied to the accused I dont know the names No one else does except for this particular witness So the significance of the issue cant be determined JUDGE MAY Yes Mr Ryneveld MR RYNEVELD Your Honours I too cannot see the evidential value The only reason Ive brought the matter to the attention is that he was being crossexamined about whether there was any documentation I felt I was dutybound to bring it to the Courts attention Having said that in our submission the names of the people who supplied it are von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm totally irrelevant to the issue that it confirms the fact that the witness said that there is corroborative evidence of his testimony That clearly is the issue To put unknown persons at risk or at danger for disclosing this information to me with the greatest of respect would not serve any useful purpose If the Court is disposed to adopt the procedure suggested by Mr Kay I would ask that any discussion of this matter be in closed session and under seal but that would be only secondary to my primary submission that it can be of no assistance to the Page Court JUDGE MAY Mr Milosevic youve heard whats said Its irrelevant in any event What relevance can it have THE INTERPRETER Microphone please Microphone please THE ACCUSED Interpretation How wouldnt the names of these criminals;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
be relevant If what the witness is saying is true how then would the names not be relevant of criminals supplying a terrorist with weapons They are very relevant highly relevant JUDGE MAY No to these proceedings to this trial and the issues in it Thats the point THE ACCUSED Interpretation Well I assume that you deal with crimes on the territory of Yugoslavia Thats at least what you claim Now if supplies of weapons to terrorist organisations is something that you consider to be legal then I dont know what I can explain here A whole series of crimes starts there And probably theft and the illegal possession of weapons on all counts And then ammunition explosives and other devices sowing death they were sold to a terrorist organisation in Kosovo JUDGE ROBINSON Mr Milosevic we deal with crimes yes but here we are concerned with the crimes charged in the indictment We are not dealing with crimes generally crimes that were committed in Yugoslavia And what you were asked to do was to demonstrate the relevance that this particular piece of evidence would have to an issue that has arisen in the trial Page As far as I am concerned you havent  you have not been able to demonstrate that relevance On the other hand there is a clear prejudice to the persons who gave that information and that is what the Chamber has von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm to consider as well THE;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
ACCUSED Interpretation But is not  is it not clear that those individuals were accomplices in the execution of terrorist attacks killings explosions You can see here that theyre purchasing kilogrammes of explosives and you know that they planted explosives in marketplaces bus stations shops coffee bars et cetera So is this not a case of accomplices in killings that arose from the activities of this terrorist organisation a member of which the witness is Trial Chamber confers JUDGE MAY We shall not require the witness to answer Since its an important issue and I think the first time its arisen in these proceedings we will explain why The Court has a power to protect those who may be put in danger because of answers which are given If there are matters which are of significance in a trial which require answers to be given the Court can also require that they be given and afford some measure of protection as the amicus has suggested However before the matter can even be considered there has to be demonstrated some relevance in the particular proceedings of the answer In this case the answer is in our judgement of no relevance at all The significance of the witnesss evidence is the way in which weapons Page were obtained Hes described that and hes produced a document which supports his evidence on that count in that he was being supplied in the way which he said Who individually was doing the supplying is;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
a matter of no relevance at all In any event even if it was the fact that the suppliers if the identity of the suppliers were given that their security their safety would be put in danger would be sufficient for us to rule that the identity should not be given So we will not require the witness to answer the question Yes Mr Milosevic THE ACCUSED Interpretation Please I think you should bear in mind my claim that in support of the KLA terrorist organisation we see the participation of the Secret Services of a whole series of countries The names of those people who supplied them with weapons  JUDGE MAY We have  we have ruled on this issue and there will von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm be no further argument on it Now have you got any more questions for this witness THE ACCUSED Interpretation I have a lot more questions and Ill try to get through as many of them as possible Q Do you know that in Pristina and the surrounding areas in there was an increased number of explosions in public places planted by the KLA Just give me a yes or no answer please so that we can make the best use of our time mean A Its not clear to me what hes asking What does this question Page Q I asked you whether you know that in the town in Pristina and the surrounding areas in the;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
course of a number of explosions were planted in public places by the KLA A I dont know about this And its not true that they were placed by  they were placed by your police forces and the army Q So you say its not true All right then How many people lost their lives in those terrorist operations the planting of bombs in Pristina and its environs Do you know that A We know that in terrorist operations carried out by the Serbian police and army we know about these But about any others I dont know Q All right I could have assumed that your answer would be what it was Thats why you used  you purchased the weapons so as not to use them Is that right Is that how Im to understand you From the environs of Podujevo later on  THE INTERPRETER The interpreters apologise but there is too much interference with the channels Were unable to hear the accused JUDGE MAY Theyre having trouble with the interpretation Ill ask the Registry to do something about the channels Theres supposed to be interference on the various channels THE INTERPRETER Were hearing the Albanian interpretation on the JUDGE MAY The interpreters say they are hearing Albanian on the BCS channel BCS channel MR KAY While we are waiting  while were waiting Your Page von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and English;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002
transcripts Page Honours it might be appropriate for me to raise a matter of the interpretation which has been brought to my attention during the course of the day It concerns the Albanian translation of various questions that were put this morning Im not a speaker of either BCS or Albanian as the Court knows but that various matters were raised with me and Ive had a chance to review the transcript to assess how a witness seems not to be understanding questions that were put that there appear to have been no linkage between questions and answers It may be appropriate that the transcript of todays proceedings be checked by the translation services to see if there were any problems in what was being relayed over the Albanian channel von  IT httpswww icty orgxcasesslobodanmilosevictransen IT htm JUDGE MAY It may have been the nature of the questions but well do that We will have it done Well go on THE WITNESS Interpretation May I ask something Your Honour JUDGE MAY Just a moment Trial Chamber and the Registrar confer THE WITNESS Interpretation  question for the Chamber JUDGE MAY Im told it should be all right Yes Mr Aliu THE WITNESS Interpretation I have a question for the Chamber May I pose the question please JUDGE MAY Not usually but what is it A The term used by Milosevic in relevance to me calling me terrorist  thats not appropriate Im here in the position of a Page;0;2;Mehmet Aliu;020426IT;IT-02-54;26.04.2002

to what is stated by the witness It is your right So I ask that the prosecutor make some arrangement for the Court to be able to hear the witness in a very clear manner Please ask the witness to speak stronger The accused must also be able to hear Perhaps push the microphone closer to her Could we ask that we go back to this clarification The number of Interahamwe that the witness saw were there indeed four I il MR PROSPER i Il Q Witness JJ how many Interahamwe were there at that time Can you hear MR PRESIDENT THE ACCUSED THE WITNESS Accused nods affirmatively  The Interahamwe that I found there were four in number including a young man who had left the army MR PRESIDENT MR PROSPER Q MR PRESIDENT We asked this question again because when the weapons were being described you said these weapons and other people had those weapons so we wanted to make sure we were talking about the four persons in particular Again approximately how many refugees Iâ€™m sorry What did she answer Interpreter listen to the question and the answer and please relate the answer to us We had the impression there were more than four because she said some had this some had that in the way of weapons but I did not hear what the answer was given by i Il O THE WITNESS the witness In principal the Interahamwe when they get together in the afternoon;0;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997

of the houses which you saw below the road While you are there seeking shelter at any time did you see Akayesu return to the bureau communal He came back to the commune at night because we had heard the noise from his vehicle he came down from the vehicle with a policeman He asked the policeman to look for the refugees He said that he didnâ€™t want the refugees there any Q Did he use that actual word the longer refugees A He said that he did not want the refugees there any longer and they ordered them to beat us up because he said wicked people wicked people he said no longer had a right to shelter What happened at this time They fell on us and started beating us O Q A Q n i il even those who had put their babies on the ground where they started beating us we scampered away and we sought refuge or we spent the night in the banana plantation thereby Were you personally beaten at that time I was also beaten up a policeman called Mushumba found me where I was resting on the ground and he beat me with the butt of his gun that time And what part of your body was hit at He beat me just behind my ear I was wounded at the same spot The others had escaped but I spent time picking up my baby and that is why he was able;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
to catch up with me THE PROSECUTOR The accused is raising his hand THE DEFENDANT I donâ€™t know if I understand the witness Mr President itâ€™s very difficult for me to talk about the interpretation because a moment ago heard the witness say that the i il bourgmestre in that time period did not enter into the bureau communal In the translation I never heard that detail mentioned I think thatâ€™s also quite bothersome to have to interrupt the proceedings at that time but the witness said she was hit near the ear and that the wound healed that she was treated that she was healed perhaps even that same day Thatâ€™s the idea I heard I did not hear this said in the French translation however Would you like for the question to be repeated for some clarification on that MR PRESIDENT issue THE DEFENDANT moment ago MR PRESIDENT Yes of course Mr President for more clarification and more details but I must also raise the concern I raised a Yes I understand that we must simply state if you want more clarification if you ask for clarification weâ€™ll do what i Il A Q A we can to make sure that is done THE DEFENDANT Thank you MrÂ° President except I find that atone point in time we are required to go back through the actual testimony given in Kinyarwanda because there are problems with the French Yes I am telling you each time you see discrepancies between;0;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
the French and the Kinyarwanda you have a right to raise MR PRESIDENT it BY THE PROSECTOR Q Witness JJ for clarification can you tell us about your injuries you received when Akayesuâ€™s police officers beat you He beat me behind the ear and there was a wound there at that same location but later on thanks to God this wound was healed At the time that these beatings were occurring where was Akayesu Apart from seeing his return I did not follow his movements because it was raining and it was dark i il Q A Q A Q Q Okay letâ€™s back up for a second When A He got out of the vehicle with two police he first arrived and stepped out of the vehicle where was he at that time Was he inside the compound of the bureau communal or was he in your area across the street officers I saw him get out by the road then the police officers began to beat us The others fled and I was still holding the baby Your group then  Iâ€™m hot sure if I asked you this before  but the group of refugees was that primarily Hutu or Tutsis if you know They were Tutsis You mentioned that after the beatings you went and spent the night I believe you said in the banana field What happened the next day office We spent that night in the tain but the following day we returned to;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
the communal When you returned to the communal office did you see Akayesu A Q Ao A Q i Il Q Okay letâ€™s stop here for a second How many of you spoke to Akayesu at that We saw him there At any point in time did you speak with We told him because we were quite tired of it all we said kill us like you did for the others shoot us if you will him time There were about ten of us but if you will we went to represent the others You say you went to represent the others did you speak to Mr Akayesu from your position across the street or did you go into the compound of the bureau communal A We found him in the compound of the bureau communal because he was no longer going inside the communal office itself THE INTERPRETER He would no longer go there often is what the interpreter is saying in the office the communal office itself BÂ¥ THE PROSECUTOR Q After you asked Akayesu to kill you what did he say if anything A He told us that there were no more I Il O QÂ° A QÂ° A Q A QÂ° A Q A bullets and that he had gone to look for more bullets in Gitarama and that the bullets had not yet been made available What happened next He asked these police officers to chase us and said that even if there were bullets;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
they would not waste them on us Did the police in fact chase you away They sent us away They said that we are to leave and that no one should ever find us there again What did you do at this time We returned to the same location because we saw that going anywhere else would have been the same situation it would be death would be waiting for us Did you stay in that location that day We stayed there the whole day but around dusk the Interahamwe would come to check on us from timetotime What would they do when they would come to check on you They would take young girls and women into a forest which was in the area i il O Q A THE PROSECUTOR MR PRESIDENT THE DEFENDANT They began to rape them Did you see this happening I would see it yes Your Honor again the accused bas his hand raised You have the floorÂ° Thank you Mr President The witness was asked who was taking the young girls in the forest and that well the witness said that the young girls were taken into the forest and that they were doing what they would with them Later on the word rape was usedÂ° I think to talk about the word tape THE PRESIDENT Who introduced the word tape Is it the interpreter you are saying Yes says the accused yes THE DEFENDANT MR PRESIDENT Well the witness has said they;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997

remember a date I had lost count of the days because I had lost my But when the prosecutor questioned you on June you remember that the first day when you were raped was April Is that That was only an estimate I estimated the date I made an estimate because in our place killings began around the date or began around the th day It was only an estimate of the How much time did you spend at the bureau office mind correct date communal Approximately two weeks Before seeking refuge at the bureau communal you knew that people were being killed there and why did you go there in spite of that who were going there were killed by bullets I didnâ€™t want to be killed by machetes and clubs So you had a preference to be killed by bullet I preferred to be killed by bullet because I thought that it was more painful to be killed by A I sought refuge there because I knew that people  kill another you only saw dead bodies A Q A Q A Q I il O clubs and hoes Q When you arrived at the bureau communal did you yourself see someone kill others I did not witness a scene where someone killed another but I saw where a place where people dead people were killed behind a school You spent two weeks at the bureau communal Therefore for two weeks you did not see anyone When I;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
arrived the first group of people had already been killed and buried But if these persons had been buried what did you do to see the dead bodies When we were going when we went there we could see them because they were unearthed by dogs and Interahamwes were asking us to rebury them once more I could not ignore that because members of my family were among those people who had been killed the bureau communal The members of your family were also killed at A Q Several people in Rwanda belonged to my family and they had been killed at the bureau communal Did you know the policemen who were working at the bureau communal A Q A Q A Q A i il O I knew some of them Could you give us their names please Yes I could give you the names If I remember them I could give you the names I could mention them Yes mention them Pardon me There is a certain Gatabaruka Urimubenshi Urimubenshi a certain Athanase who was the brigadier of the police force That should be the equivalent of a corporal maybe but I donâ€™t remember his name There was another one called Mugenzi and a certain Mushumba At the moment Iâ€™m trying to mention their names but this is a long time ago I can therefore only remember the names that I bave just given you I donâ€™t remember anymore names Q Thatâ€™s all right It is not serious;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
During your stay at the bureau communal did Mr Akayesu threaten you A The only thing I can say is that he didnâ€™t treat me well He was an authoritarian He could also protect us He didnâ€™t feed us He did nothing for us and when I went to see him he asked the policeman to get me away from there Q A Q A Q A I Il If I understand well Mr Akayesu did not personally threaten you I went to see him begging him to kill me as they had killed others Why did you address yourself to him It is because he is the only one I was seeing and I knew that he was a superior of the commune He was a leader of the commune  But is he the one who was killing people He is not the one who was killing but  THE INTERPRETER Pardon me Can the witness repeat because she has been using long sentences which cannot be easily understood The question asked is simple Is it Jean Paul Akayesu who was killing THE WITNESS I did not personally see Akayesu kill Ai I can say is that when we arrived at the bureau communal he did nothing for us whereas he was in a position to do something BY MR TIANGAYE Q On June you testified that Mr Akayesu ordered the Interahamwe to beat you up Can you tell us the number of those Interahamwes A Q A;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
i Il O Q A Q A He was the one who gave authorization because he saw people beat us up and he said nothing Did you see him order give orders that you be beaten up The reason why I say that he was the one who gave orders is because when you when we arrived at the communal bureau and when he went to do his rounds when we sought shelter in the houses that I showed you along the road when we ran away from the tain into those houses when he came back from his rounds or patrols with the policemen he found us where we were and he would beat us and we would run away and we ran helterskelter and we tan in all directions and he saw us run in all directions under the tain What was the number of these Interahamwe At night we were beaten up by policemen and during the day we were beaten up by the Interahamwe We were beaten up by the Interahamwe by the police and in the evening by the police I asked a question on the number of Interahamwe I cannot estimate the number of the Interahamwe but I realized that there were many I could not count them especially as they came to beat I s Q A Q A Q A i il Q A Q A us up and there were many But this morning you said there were four I said;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
that we were beaten up by four but these were not the four who stayed there everyday to beat us up Everyday the number increased I talked about four Interahamwe who I found there but later on the number their number increased And how many of them were there on the last day At that time I had lost my mind I could not count them I could only see that there were many commune These Interahamwe did they come from the Taba They came from the Taba commune Some of them I knew because they came from surrounding areas At the Taba commune there were so many Interahamwe it was so many of them that they didnâ€™t have to look for reinforcement elsewhere How many people were beaten up by the Interahamwe I cannot know that I cannot estimate their number because when I arrived the people I found there they were almost dead They looked dead This morning Madam you gave a figure It was only an estimate because I could not go I Q A Q A I Il O in there to begin counting them Did you estimate their number or what estimate did you give I estimated their number at about sixty or more but this may not be the exact figure because there were many It was only an estimate I did not count them Do you remember that four months ago you estimated their number at five hundred In fact there were indeed;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
many I had lost my  I had lost consciousness I could not count them Now you lost consciousness or what I had lost my mind I am sorry I had lost my MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS mind BY MR TIANGAYE Q I understand that you lost your mind but between sixty and five hundred there is a major a very big difference MR PRESIDENT We have agreed that in such cases the statement be given to the Tribunal The prosecutor can you give us copies of the witnessâ€™s statement i Il O MR PROSPER MR PRESIDENT May we mark that as Exhibit Thank you very much Counsel you may continue MR TIANGAYE Thank you Mr President BY MR TIANGAYE Q I was just reminding the witness between sixty and five hundred there is a great difference MR PRESIDENT Please indicate on what page Counsel you see the number five hundred I see it is in the second paragraph AIl right Is that what you are referring to the second paragraph in the French version where it says there are about five hundred persons at this location So the witness is saying today sixty or more refugees were at the bureau communal and the defence counsel is reminding him that he has stated to the prosecutor that there are some five hundred persons at that location Is it sixty now or is it five hundred THE WITNESS I never said five hundred I think the person who wrote that made;0;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
a mistake with the number Maybe there was a mistake BY MR TIANGAYE Q A What weapons did the Interahamwe have They had clubs They had axes and swords and also small hoes They also had pointed pickaxes Pgs  reported by M Young  I Il O Q Why didnâ€™t you stay then with these You said you spent two weeks at the bureau communal with your baby Yes I had my baby when I left the bureau communal I still had my baby What did you do to feed the child Well to survive since I had some acquaintances in the commune Iâ€™d ask some people for something to eat and I would use this food to feed my baby people Well when you go and youâ€™re Tutsi Tutsis would be killed and then their livestock would be eaten How many times did you leave bureau communal to go look for food Well the entire period I spent at the commune office I went to various MR TIANGAYE Q A Q A A Q A I I O neighbors in the commune asking for food Q Would you go there during the night or during the day A At times I would go during the day but by going through the banana fields and sometimes in the evening as well some Q A Q A i il O wellwishers and believers would come bring us some water in Jerry cans to the communal office And you did this;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
without the knowledge of the police officers and the Interahamwe The Interahamwe would come in the evening and they would beat us and then they would return and resume with the looting and the pillaging throughout the countryside But you said you were surrounded during the day by the Interahamwe and at nights by the police How would you be able to get out We were not closed into a closed area The Interahamwe would come to verify that we were still there They would come around eight oâ€™clock to see we were there Sometimes they would beat us When they had something to do in the countryside to steal or to loot then they gave us a break when they left then they would come back in the evening to verify once again if we were still there Otherwise they were not guarding i Il O Q So youâ€™re not in a closed area Youâ€™re A Well we would come there actually to us if you will the entire time We were not in a closed area we were close to the road in a place where thereâ€™s nothing to eat and where you were being beaten and where you were being raped Why would you always return to the same place then seek out out own deaths We had commanded and demanded that we be killed but our death kept being postponed tomorrow and the next day you were able to see You stated that you did not;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
see anyone kill anyone You did not see Akayesu kill anyone and that you only saw the dead bodies and that you drew from this the conclusion that someone had been killed using clubs small hoes or perhaps even knives How did you come to this distinction A Well I drew this conclusion from what I saw because in my own area Tutsis would be killed using these types of Q You also talked about the cadavers that i il Q A Q A Q A instruments Werenâ€™t there any firearms in Taba The first group that was killed at the communal office was killed using grenades They put them somewhere in a closed area and they threw grenades at them And this grenade killed everyone Itâ€™s possible that those who did not die then were then finished off but when we arrived there at the communal office we were told that they had been killed by Q Did the Interahamwe and the police who beat you are they all in prison today or are there some who still who are free grenade men A You cannot place all the Interahamwe from Taba commune in prison You can net find enough room to put them all in a prison Many of them are still free You talked a great deal about tape To your knowledge were there cases of gang raping in Rwanda before April I donâ€™t know of any others elsewhere Q A Q A i Il O because;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
I did not travel a great deal in the country I only saw these type of things during the war And how would you explain this phenomenon Well when I think about it I feel I feel a great deal of sorrow Did these rapes take place in public Yes the rapes were public Because for example I was raped by a group of people who raped me in the presence of children When I meet these children  and Iâ€™ma mother myself  and when I think of these combinations I really feel bad Even the persons who were raping us were a young people younger then us while we ourselves were mothers Try to imagine a mother raped by young boys younger than the woman herself and even by bandits and when I think about that the war comes alive again inside of me I pray to God to try to help me to deal with this to try to cope with it Q You said that some of the rapes took il O place in the forest or in the banana plantations is that correct Ao Anywhere where there were violent acts that were carried out because the authorities had abandoned us Anyone had full reign over us No one was there to QÂ° What was the approximate age of the protect us rapists I AÂ° I think perhaps the oldest person was around thirty years of age It depended on the group of attackers that one;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997
would encounter and among the attackers the majority was made up of young rascals the persons who would find you in your hiding place would have their way with you They would do anything they wanted with you because you would think perhaps instead of dying today perhaps that I might die tomorrow QÂ° A And the youngest person was how old Twentytwo or twentythree or maybe more maybe older In any case it was not someone who had the same age as a mother Moreover even else where else ii Q A Q A i Il O where outside of out country a mother should be respected However during the war in our country in Rwanda nudity of a mother a mother was humiliated because of her public nudity This is why it would be very difficult to still find my heart Please pray for me Did you remarry after these events I was able to remarry but my life is really never back on track since that time since I was rendered handicapped What handicap are you referring to Because of the blows I received and also because of the rape I donâ€™t know if I was contaminated I can no longer farm because I can no longer use a hoe because of the pain I have in my ribs Whereas I used to live based on the food I would grow So you can imagine the very heavy sorrow that the war has cost Q Going back;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000026/1;ICTR-96-04;23.10.1997

only an approximation I gave that date but I donâ€™t know the exact date because I know that the war broke out around the th the th of April Please allow the Tribunal to ask because you raised the question and the answer was not given Please we are going to i il O ask the question again Weâ€™re going to ask again the question concerning how many times the witness was raped Yesterday she says she was raped only in the cultural center today sheâ€™s adding the forest so we are going to ask how many times she was raped and where X microphone please She stated yesterday for the first time that they brought me into the cultural center and the first time I was brought into the cultural center and that they passed by Akayesu and they saw the Interahamwe and they entered the cultural center  Please translate Will the interpreter translate I did so your Honor lâ€™ve translated You told us yesterday that the Interahamwe brought her into the cultural center and that she passed by Akayesu when going into this room Is that MR PRESIDENT THE INTERPRETER already MR PRESIDENT i il O right THE WITNESS Yes thatâ€™s right MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT Once you were in the room the Interahamwe then fell upon ber to rape her is that correct Yes thatâ€™s what I said yesterday Now with regards to ber she said a young man entered into a corner of;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
this Yes okay room THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT Yes thatâ€™s right He took his clothing off and threw his clothing on the floor is that correct and then had relations with me I prefer to use that terminology rather than go into more detail had relations with me there in that location THE WITNESS Yes thatâ€™s what I said yesterday i il O MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT This man had relations with me twice and then another person came to do the same Yes thatâ€™s correct So here there are two persons but three acts and then a third person came again and then he used a condom in order to enter me THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT Yes thatâ€™s what I said So I understand that in this room there were four acts with three different persons and it was stated that the following days the Interahamwe would come to visit us to beat us You also talked about a meeting which took between JeanPaul Akayesu and then after that the Interahamwe brought us again to the cultural center It was like we were dead we could no longer walk THE WITNESS i il O Yes Akayesu the teachers and also the businessmen MR PRESIDENT So Iâ€™m saying Interahamwe After that the Interahamwe brought them into the room again and she said it was like she was dead she could hardly walk so that in this room she says she was raped only twice on that occasion THE;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
WITNESS MR PRESIDENT That is what I said So if I understand rightly in the room of the cultural center she was raped six times How many times was she raped in the forest THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS Yes MR PRESIDENT Once I remember that a group of assailants raped me Was that in the forest Once or several times i il THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT I was it was as if I was dead I had become numb Sometimes they raped me and I would not even feel it so I could hot say exactly how many times they raped me So then we would say they raped you at least seven times at least seven times because there are other times that you do not remember I met a group of assailants before what did you say The group of assailant which raped me was before I reached the commune this was still in the rural area So if I understand rightly she was raped before she reached the cultural center THE WITNESS Yes MR PRESIDENT So in the final analysis she doesnâ€™t know i i Il JUDGE PILLAY that THE WITNESS how many times she was raped She was raped several times at least seven times I just want to have an idea of what happened to ber Thank you Counsel you have the floor once again Judge Pillay has the floor I think itâ€™s fait that;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
the evidence you gave yesterday is reported correctly But what you said yesterday was the first tape that occurred was in this forest near the primary school where you were raped twice and that was before you were taken to the cultural center Thatâ€™s what you said yesterday Can you confirm I was I had just arrived at the commune That is where we got off before we entered the commune Otherwise before reaching the commune I met groups of other assailants who raped me I talked of this tape in the forest before talking of rapes that were committed within the room Otherwise I was near I Il Q AÂ° Qo AÂ° Qo Ao O the commune JUDGE PILLAY Thatâ€™S what you told us yesterday Thank yOU MR PRESIDENT BY MR TIANGAYE Thank you for that clarification I give the floor to the counsel Thank you Mr president When you were raped in the forest did the interahamwes use condoms The person who raped me in the forest near the commune never used a condom When you were raped in the forest were you raped by one person or by several persons In the forest behind the primary school is only one person who raped me In the month of April you declared that you were raped by three persons Maybe I was confused or I made a mix up because at some time in point I spent the night else where and the other people raped me in;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
the house where I spent the night before coming I mentioned all O Q A Q A i Il O MR PRESIDENT MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT these people and maybe there is a confusion As concerns the cultural center did the rapists use condoms Only one person used a condom The others raped me without using a condom How many persons raped you without using For the first group since there were four in number three persons did not use condoms condoms I think itâ€™s a bit painful to take her through the same experience again unless you are insisting on the number of times Mr President I understand but there are a number of contradictions In fact she was raped so many times that she no longer remembers the exact number of times Well she gave so many details I Il So just remind her exactly of what she said MR TIANGAYE BY MR TIANGAYE Q That is what I am doing You said you saw Mr Akayesu at the entrance to the cultural center and that he Mr Akayesu was telling the women that hence forth he should not be asked the question as to what the taste of Tutsi women is Is that correct We could correct This question was addressed to Interahamwe not to the women That question by Mr Akayesu was addressed to the Interahamwe and hot to MR PRESIDENT the women THE WITNESS When they dragged us for a second;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
time into the room they left us in front of the bureau communal and later on when they were raping us he approached the place and told them donâ€™t ask me any longer what the taste of a Tutsi woman was Q A Q A Q A Q i Il O BY MR TIANGAYE Was he addressing the women or the Interahamwe or both groups He was addressing these young men who were torturing us who were humiliating us in this house Q You said that Mr Akayesu did not participate in the tape is that correct Why would he then be talking of the taste of Tutsi women A I did hot  I wouldnâ€™t say that he was involved but he was the one supervising these acts of rape Could you describe to us the interior of the cultural center It is a house with cement steps with various levels with various levels There is no room in that hall in the hall of the bureau communal except for the staircase which is found in the middle of the room or the hall During the events madam you said you were wounded In what part of the body were you wounded  Is that all I A The place healed Il O Q Q A Q A A A A policeman who was with Akayesu and who came late at night wounded me behind the ear He found me when I was trying to pick up my child;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
who was lying down when others had already run away He gave me he hit me with the butt of the gun behind the ear and the place was opened the spot was opened Are there scars on that spot So there is no scar on the area on the spot There is no scar Yesterday you also stated that the girls who were raped were thrown into a river What river were they thrown into They were girls who came from the Bogaba sector that were thrown in river Bogaba communal Since the Bogaba sector and Murehe sector of Taba commune neighboring to the Shyorongi commune of Kigali this river divides the Taba commune from the Shyorongi commune Q How far is that river from the bureau Q A Q A I il Q A This river is approximately how many kilometers from the bureau Communal I do not know That would be known by Somebody who has been to school How were the bodies the dead bodies conveyed to that river They did not carry the corpses because late at night the girls slipped away and went home went to their houses And when they arrived home groups of assailants in their neighborhood took them to the river did you know this But you were at the bureau commune how There is a neighbor who came from Kabgaye who told me that on return to Kabgaye he found that the girls had been thrown into the river It;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
is when I asked him of the news about when I asked him about the girls with whom we were together at the commune that is when he told me that the girls had been thrown into the river Q A last question At what moment did you give your child to Mr Bayisenge and Mrs Kabanyana A Q A I Il Q A O I do not remember the exact date but I think that must have been at the end of April beginning of May I think it was early May And then what date did you finally leave the bureau Communal I do not remember the date but I know that it was still in the month of April I remember that at that rime it was raining a lot but I do not remember the exact date It was still raining We were always in tain throughout the day At that time I could hot distinguish or associate dates fo days If I understand rightly you had given your child before you left the bureau Communal No I had already left the Commune the bureau communal I have already explained to you that when I was at the commune I had my baby on my back Itis when I went to buy the baby some doughnut that I met Some people who told me that those who were with me had been killed and then I had to turn back I il O AÂ° Q A;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997

of crisis Once I was asked if I did not approach him for any of the criminal acts but when somebody is leading killers assassins he is also a killer he is also a murderer an assassin He was eonvening meetings here and there sharing the meetings meeting of the population and he was preaching that the only enemy is the Tutsi who must be chased away We were exterminated in his presence Even if you go to the Taba commune you will see that the situation is different from that of other communes with regard to killings In the Taba commune you would see that killings  killings  there were fewer killings than in the Taba I didnâ€™t quite understand Can you repeat that answer again or the statement you made If I compare the killings in my commune to killings in other neighboring communes I would see that there was no other commune in which there were more killings than in the Taba commune JUSTICE ASPEGREN THE WITNESS I Il O commune When we were escaping we escaped to other communes when we could have the luck of passing But those for example who were running from other communes to Taba they had no opportunity of escaping maybe escaping death For example I went through the Musambira commune I was able to go across that commune I went to Musambira commune On arrival at Musambira I met an old woman who welcomed me who gave me warm;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
water and she continued treating me She put me in her house she gave me something to eat and some garments to put on In Musambira commune the burgomaster had given orders that no woman nor child should be killed But in the Taba commune even mad people were killed simply because they were Tutsi JUSTICE ASPEGREN MR PRESIDENT Thank you Madame BY MR TIANGAYE Counsel you have the floor if you have something to add Q A i il I would like to ask the following question From what date did killings begin effectively in Taba commune I do hot know the exact date AIl I know is that after the crash of President Habyarimanaâ€™s plane the climate or the relations were tense They started pushing you off when we tried to approach them to ask them anything they answered us like wild people When you see the behavior of your neighbors who start pushing you off well we started losing out mind We no longer spent the night in out homes but outside because the climate the relationship between the neighbors were very bad You would understand why I cannot remember the date when killings effectively started Q The presidentâ€™s plane was shot down on April Did killings begin immediately in Taba A The plane  the crash of the plane took place on April but we learned of this only on the th of April Killings started immediately because when we were at home we could hear;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
Q Approximately how many days thereafter did commune gunshots i il Q A killings begin A Approximately two weeks after the crash of the plane We first saw people who were coming from the Shyorongi commune who sought refuge in our commune and they told us that the situation in their commune was very tense that their houses had been burnt down that the situation was not at all good The people of Runda also started escaping with their livestock They sought refuge in Taba Several of them were killed in the Taba commune because this is where they had sought refuge Therefore in out commune and the Kayenzi commune killings had not yet begun When people saw  when the population saw that the Tutsi were escaping the poor climate became even worse and widespread In short we bave never had peace since the death of Habyarimana until when we were exterminated During the two weeks which preceded killings in Taba were there no killings in neighboring In out commune in Taba commune and also in Kayenzi the killings began that same day When communes I il Q Q A MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS are three of us BY MR TIANGAYE the killings began in Taba commune they immediately exterminated all the people who were there all in one day and Taba commune had a large number of Tutsis But today the commune has been so ruined that itâ€™s full of ruins and destroyed buildings You canâ€™t find a;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
single survivor You stated in your family that there are only three survivors Who are these three survivors No names please You can say itâ€™s my father itâ€™s my mother or my cousin but no names My little sister my cousin  my little sister my cousin my female cousin and myself There You said there were more persons killed in Taba than in the other communes Do you know how many people were killed in communes like Runda Shyorongi or perhaps Kayenzi The reason I said this is because when I consider what happened around me I didnâ€™t see anyone who survived while I had a lot of neighbors And so sometimes I would find Q A I Il MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS answer families that were not fortunate enough to bave even a single person who escaped death If I understand you correctly this is a subjective and personal assessment Well for example when I would see the family that I had this was an entire village but everyone was  no one is left The young persons the older persons everyone is gone Today the Rwandan government is taking the parcels of land and distributing these lands to other people as if this is new land This is not the question that weâ€™re asking the witness Counsel Tiangaye asked what enabled the witness to establish that there were more deaths in Taba commune than elsewhere during the killings of and as an example he asked how many;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997
deaths there were in other communes If she does not know she need only say that she does not know It was simply an approximation and thatâ€™s all That would be the limit of her The reason why I say this is because I was in Taba commune I was there myself I was a witness an eyewitness of what happened and I saw that it was exaggeration of events there MR PRESIDENT Ai right Very well That does hot permit you to say there are more deaths there Maybe there are a lot of deaths in Taba but that doesnâ€™t give you the authority to say that there are more deaths in Taba Isnâ€™t that right THE WITNESS BY MR TIANGAYE Well yes I admitted that perhaps Before the killings began in Taba had the residents of Taba organized some sort of civilian defence Nowhere in Taba organized any sort of selfdefence or civilian defence Do you know if before the killings whether or not the accused Akayesu defended any of the Tutsis in that region I never saw him protect anyone I only saw him doing killings I saw killings I never saw any protection taking place If he had protected then people would have escaped i il Q A Q A death MR PRESIDENT i Il All right Thank you Witness JJ Thank you for having been willing to come forward and testify before this Tribunal I understand that it must hot have been very easy for;1;3;Witness JJ;TRA000027/1;ICTR-96-04;24.10.1997

dont know whether it was the burgomaster or Kubwimana All I know is that the burgomaster was the leader of the commune But you said it was Kubwimana who gave orders to the Interahamwe What type of orders did he give to the Interahamwe He took them where the population had resisted killings REX LEAR OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTRCHAMBER I A Yes but when they arrived the population Q A Q Q A Q A Q In what areas did the people did the population in what cells did the people resist killings Nowhere because they were afraid and one never they heard that they started killing You said that there was some resistance in some cells where Kubwimana was to carry the Interahamwe there so as to kill people would generally be aware and afraid The people would fear and therefore they would start killing Can you state that again please Can you restate the question Can you repeat the question The witness was saying that there were cells where people resisted killings and Kubwimana ordered the Interahamwe to kill where people put up a kind of resistance He warned them before and when he heard that they did not work When you say he who are you referring to REX LEAR OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTRCHAMBER I A Well they then that is the people who did not kill their neighbors were warned MR PRESIDENT The Presidents microphone please This morning on several occasions she used the word work So as;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
to avoid any misunderstanding what does the witness THE WITNESS mean by the work Work meant killing MR PRESIDENT Thats clear now Another question is did the witness see Akayesu talk to or give orders to the Interahamwe Did he see it once or several times All I know is that he told Interahamwe that they had to chase us away from the bureau communal because he had not given any shelter or refuge to the Inyenzi Counsel I give you the floor once again Thank you Mr President REX LEAR OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTRCHAMBER I THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT MR TIANGAYE BY MR TIANGAYE Q A Q A Q A Q A Q Did the Interahamwes begin killing before arriving at the bureau communal Killing in the rural areas or at the bureau communal Killing in the rural areas Yes they started on the th So if that be the case why did they seek refuge at the bureau communal I told you that the Hutu who had hidden me is the very person that informed me that there would be a meeting convened by the burgomaster After the meeting that gentleman informed me that anyone who had hidden another had to send the person hidden to the bureau communal I believe that he wanted to know the number of people still left because later on many people were killed Who wanted to learn the number of people still left The burgomaster it is the burgomaster who chaired the meeting;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
saying anyone who had hidden anyone should bring that person up But how did the burgomaster know that REX LEAR OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTRCHAMBER I Q A Q A Q A there were people hiding Tutsis A He convened a meeting To my mind this was a kind of research He had already said that killings should stop so he requested that everyone anybody who was hiding someone should bring that person up No response It isnt him who ordered the killings You said that it is Silas Kubwimana who organized the killings No Silas was an Interahamwe like many other people When you were at the bureau communal was the bureau communal fenced Yes There is a fence which separates the road which separates the road There is a hedge which separates the road from the field or the area of the bureau communal Q What did you do when your benefactor asked you or the person who protected you asked you to go to the bureau communal A Since I had spent several days without shaking in the hole where I was hidden he REX LEAR OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTRCHAMBER I understood that in that way I was going to be relieved At least if I left the hole I was going to feel better Q Can you describe for us that hole JUSTICE ASPEGREN Thank you Madam I would like to know exactly why you went to the bureau communal Why With what intention what wish led you to;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997

for two days without any food without eating anything There were also other peasants who were tender hearted and who were aware of our condition Q The aggression of the policeman named Mushumba did it take place before the rape by Rafiki or afterwards A The aggression took place after the first time after the first rape by Mushumba Beg your pardon When I left Rafikis house and I went back to the bureau communal thats when Mushumba was aggressive towards me MARILYN G YOUNG OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I So after the rape you somehow were able to run away You were strong enough to run away I was able to run but not very fast but in any case we were not going far because we knew that the people were also waiting for us Could you tell us on what date you were raped by Mr Rafiki I wasnt able to know the exact date because the conditions under which I was did not enable me to think correctly Was it in April or  It was in the month of May but if I think about the correct precise date I am afraid of making a Currently is Mr Rafiki free or is he in prison mistake He is dead How did he die It would seem that he died following gunshot Q Was he assassinated Was he killed Its possible that he died on his way to exile And what about Seminani Seminani is;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997

what was the purpose of buying that grenade MR PRESIDENT MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS I think this is a matter of interpretation The first witness said that some preferred to be killed by bullets instead of being macheteed cut down by machetes Now she is saying that some Tutsi would buy these grenades so that they are not killed by machetes but this didnt stop them from being killed by machetes The witness said that they were Tutsi who bought grenades No she said that they wanted to be killed using grenades and not by machetes Thats why they bought the grenades Now ask her why these Tutsi bought the grenades for them to be killed with They would buy grenades so that the Interahamwe would kill them with these grenades instead of having their ears chopped off or their fingers cut off MARILYN G YOUNG OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I MR TIANGAYE bullets MR PRESIDENT Yes Before in the previous statement the Tutsi would pay for them to be killed using The objective is the same They preferred rather to be killed by grenades or bullets rather than being chopped up Thats it  BY MR TIANGAYE Q So why did they wait for grenades whereas they could have killed these people using clubs or machetes It was a kind of torture because there was no lack of weapons for killing They wanted simply to make them wait and have them suffer slowly Mr President I;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997

is indeed pertinent So the question will be repeated to the witness How did you know by the pseudonym JJ that the prosecutor was referring to your sister THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT Because we normally use her name and I was wondering how the prosecution knew her name Are you saying that you call her Gigi Is her name Gigi Is that what you thought SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I  THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT That is her name THE WITNESS yes MR PRESIDENT MR PROSPER You call her Gigi then Is that her name Is that the name you used even during the war Thats how she was called even during the war So its not your invention Mr Prosecutor It is not you who invented the pseudonym She is known as JJ Gigi in French My instructions literally I told her not to mention the name of her sister and to call her JJ and I think shes following my instructions in order not to identify her sister Counsel is aware that they are sisters it says that in the witness statement and hes insisting on this for reasons that go beyond me We do not want this witness to be identified We are trying to protect her identity so shes been instructed to refer to her sister as JJ SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I MR PRESIDENT But up until now we have understood Mr Prosecutor that she called her;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
JJ Gigi in order to hide her identity But when the witness says that her sister was known as JJ we were wondering  we were thinking that in fact it was you who gave her the name JJ Gigi but this is not apparent anymore because she was known as Gigi before MR PROSPER MR PRESIDENT I want to make the record clear  Lets not go into a discussion Can we have this clarified Is it the prosecutor who told her that her sister should be known as JJ Gigi or did her sister in fact was her sister in fact known as Gigi JJ It was her nickname I dont know how the prosecutor came to know about it  THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT MR TIANGAYE All right We will move on Thank you I had believed that this was a pseudonym given to the witness by the SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I prosecution and I didnt know that the name actually belonged to the witness BY MR TIANGAYE Q This morning the witness stated this morning A Let me explain At the end of the war when I that her sister died at the bureau communal and that her body had been eaten by dogs I want no know whether at that point in time there were no people to bury dead bodies because she herself said that the body of Ntereye was buried by people who were at the bureau communal;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
So why was her sisters body not also buried in the same manner went back to the place I found that there was only a skeleton Part of the head was there and part of the back And I said to myself that maybe she was eaten up by dogs as this had been the case with other bodies there So with regard to the burial my sister was not buried because there were no longer any Tutsis in the bureau communal whereas for Ntereye when he was buried there were still refugees Q When your sister died you were still in Taba and there were still Tutsi present and you were at Rafikis house SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I A But I couldnt bury her because I didnt have any right whatsoever MR PRESIDENT Since three oclock were here We want to know whether you intend to close or whether you need to continue MR TIANGAYE With your permission may I speak about this with my client for a minute please sir THE INTERPRETER Mr President the witness is requesting for some rest if there is still a lot of questions Were coming to that Well see in a few Mr President may we continue MR PRESIDENT to be asked MR TIANGAYE minutes MR PRESIDENT Yes MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT We have only a few questions still to go Request the witness to have a little more patience so that we finish with this once;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
and SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I later MR TIANGAYE BY MR TIANGAYE Q A Q A Q for all rather than have her come back again Hes apologizing for the difficulties it is putting the witness through Do you know that Huye military camp From my hiding place near the commune office I heard mention made of Huye camp and it was said that it was a military camp and that this was happening while I was at the commune office And where is this Huye camp I dont know where this camp is All that I know is that I spent some  a few days while I was hiding at the bureau communal that I heard mention made of this camp Could you give us the approximate number of days that she spent at Mr Rafikis house and over which she was beaten by Mr Mushuba number of days nor the date I only remember the month But with regards to the dates and the number of days I was going through an atrocious life I cant remember A I cannot remember the day nor the date the Q Can you tell us exactly at which place your SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I Q A Q A Q A Q A sister was raped A I cannot know whether the place where I found her is the place that she was raped at because I didnt ask myself whether she;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
had been raped in the same place or not I dont know whether she had been able to move away from where she was raped to the point where I found her Where exactly was it that you found her please I found her in the courtyard of the bureau communal quite close to the hedge which separates the bureau communal from the road Was it not in the hole No she never went to the hole because she could not walk was in the hole I remember you said to the prosecutor that it No I did not say that I think that  I can explain I did say that I myself left with the people who were going to the hole and that my little sister was unable to walk And she was not in the hole No MR PRESIDENT The hole is the same thing as the mass grave is that not so SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I Â· THE WITNESS Yes MR PRESIDENT THE ACCUSED Mr Akayesu you have the floor Thank you Mr President time MR PRESIDENT I think there is still confusion when questions are being put to the witness and I find it is honest to say this for instance just now there was a question asking what she had said Now the defence was asking about the statements made previously not what she was saying this morning Now according to the interpretation the witness said that it;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
was this morning So I think we need to be specific and stick to the It is up to your counsel to have said that in the statement that you made before the prosecutor in the office of the prosecutor but he said to the prosecution Now there would be confusion in that case Now Counsel the statement you were referring SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I Â· THE WITNESS and the road MR PRESIDENT to was it made this morning in response to a question from the prosecution or before the office of the prosecutor Could you put the question once again and then we will see what she answers Now shes saying that her sister was in the mass grave in the hole The militia man who raped her was called Celestin Seminani Now in the statement before the office of the prosecutor the sister was raped in the hole opposite the bureau communal I found my sister again near the fence which separates the courtyard from the bureau communal I am saying that apparently before the office of the prosecutor you said My sister was raped by Celestin Seminani  and Im wondering whether were talking about the basin in front of the commune office Lets turn the question around Do you know where your sister was raped You found her near the hedge on the other  or near the fence but do you know where she was raped SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I Â·Â·Â· Â·Â·Â·Â·   Â·Â·    c Â·Â·   c Â·Â·Â·Â·  cec THE WITNESS When I left Rafikis house I spent two days in Rafikis house And when I left I came back and I was told that she was raped where I found her MR PRESIDENT i THE WITNESS Therefore near the fence I explained and I said that she was raped and she spoke to me of people who raped her but she couldnt even put her legs together I didnt ask her to explain to me the exact place where she was raped whether it was in front of the bureau communal or there where you are speaking MR PRESIDENT of THE WITNESS So it is only the place at which she found her at the hedge near the bureau communal but she does not know where she was raped where the sister was raped We must be clear on this I know that the place I mentioned is the place where I found her but I do not know where she was raped And thats where I left her and she was unable to walk SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT MR PROSPER So the statement which says that she was raped in the basin that never took place No no It is quite brief She made her statement according to which her sister was raped in the;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
basin or she didnt make the statement as such Yes I said it There where I found her but I didnt say there where she was raped Mr Prosecutor what is your observation The only thing I would ask of the Chamber is to ask defence counsel when he is referring to the statement to be true to the statement What I understood from his line of questioning he was trying to imply that the witness found her sister in a hole And he was just reading portions of the statement I think the counsel needs to be true to the statement read it accurately and ask firstly if the witness made the statement as opposed to assuming the statement was in fact made Thank you MR PRESIDENT Thank you Mr Prosecution We have corrected SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I that All right Counsel please continue MR TIANGAYE Mr President I have distorted nothing whatsoever The text which was produced by the prosecution says indeed that the rape occurred in the basin of the commune office So there has been no distortion by the defence BY MR TIANGAYE Q Now before the office of the prosecutor you said that your sister was raped by Celestin Seminani Today you also mentioned another person named as Heridion Who is that person Did you not speak of him before the office of the prosecutor mistake can be apportioned to the person who wrote the statement or the person who;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
read the statement A I mentioned the two names I dont know if the Q It would seem there are a lot of mistakes arising from the transcriptions I also noted Madame that you said that your sister died while you were still in Rafikis house A Q Yes In the statement that you made before the office of the prosecutor you said When I left SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER Â·I CTR  CHAMBER I Rafikis house I found my sister dying  Now I want to know did your sister die while you were still at Mr Rafikis house or had she already died after you left Mr Rafikis house It is Rafiki who told me that she was dead while I was still at his house during the second episode when I was at his house during the second episode You stated that Mr Akayesu allegedly said that he didnt want to see any Tutsis in the Taba commune Now your aunt who is a Tutsi is she still alive Thank you Yes shes there shes still alive To say that shes alive Im saying that yes but shes alive because she was married to a Hutu man She had Hutu children and their children should not be killed Q Im asking you this question When you left Taba which commune did you go to A I remained in Taba commune I continued to hide in houses of people who knew me Q Im going to read;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
your statement before the office of the prosecutor Its the second last paragraph on page After the rape I did not SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I A Q A Q A return to the commune office because Akayesu had already said that he had no more room for Inyenzi and the Interahamwe and because there were a lot of Interahamwe there and because there were a lot of Interahamwe there As I was fleeing to Kayenzi I was raped on several  This means that you left Taba and you went to occasions  Kayenzi A Its Gacurabwenge on the border of the Taba and Kayenzi commune The text is on page of the English Theres a notice indicating Kayenzi commune but the place where I was living was a house which was in Taba commune Q So you remained on the border between Kayenzi and the other commune up until the arrival of the RPF A Yes thats where they found me MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT JUSTICE PILLAY I thank you I have concluded Mr President Thank you I give the floor to Judge Pillay Witness NN I have one question It relates to SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I THE WITNESS JUSTICE PILLAY Thank you MR PRESIDENT your evidence about the people who were killed at the pit near the commune Now this morning you told us that you did not see Akayesu nearby but in your statement to the prosecutors;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
office you said that Akayesu was present the whole time Now can you explain this discrepancy and tell us what was the true position I can explain to you the matter concerning Akayesu He was not present at the pit where people were being killed but he gave the orders for the killings but he remained in his office He had his subordinates He didnt need to go to the pit to witness the killings I want some clarification on Judge Pillays question You said Akayesu had given orders for killing Is this a deduction that youre making from Akayesus behavior or did he give instructions She says Akayesu gave orders to kill Is this a deduction shes making from Akayesus behavior who did nothing to protect her or did she hear the instructions the SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I orders THE WITNESS I explained that he gave orders He told Mushuba and Rafiki an Interahamwe known as Rafiki that they should make us  they should chase us out of the courtyard of the bureau communal and that they were not to give any refuge provide refuge to any Inyenzi But what happened is that people were killed in my MR PRESIDENT presence Yes but this is why  the question Im putting to you is more interesting Now what did she hear between remove these Inyenzi from Taba and kill these Inyenzi in Taba Theyre two different things THE WITNESS As far as I;1;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997
k now in my opinion Id say that its as if he had said that the killings take place MR PRESIDENT Now this is what I thought Its indeed a deduction that shes making So I think it is wiser to say that it is a deduction that shes making and not that she heard orders SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I Any questions Mr Prosecutor The defence I would like that that be put in the record that it was indeed a deduction made MR TIANGAYE MR PRESIDENT What is your program for us tomorrow Mr Prosecutor Do you have your last witness for us tomorrow MR PROSPER Yes we will And I will inform the Chamber tomorrow on the progress of the defence witnesses and we will be prepared to hear the defence on Wednesday What does that mean Are they coming tomorrow We hope so We have to consult with the chief of the witness victim support unit who has been working on the issue all day and they know that everyone here would like to have them here tomorrow So we will check on the progress this evening and tomorrow morning MR PRESIDENT Im speaking of the prosecution witnesses not SALLY G KOHN OFFICIAL REPORTER ICTR  CHAMBER I MR PRESIDENT MR PROSPER  the defence witnesses Is your witness here in Arusha One room away MR PROSPER MR PRESIDENT So tomorrow we will have your last witness Now for the witnesses who;0;3;Witness NN;TRA000034/1;ICTR-96-04;03.11.1997

A Q A Q A Q MR BOULÃ‰ Most grateful BY MR BOULÃ‰ This is what I said houses is that correct Yes that is correct MR MOSES Thank you MR PRESIDENT BY MR BOULÃ‰ quarrelling Q Witness you told us yesterday in your testimony that in your commune tragic and bloody events started on the th of April is that correct th of April And it is correct to say that if one understands your testimony the events began with the torching of And were these houses torched in your commune or in neighbouring communes The events began in a neighbouring commune and immediately came to our commune I was wondering whether my friend can also slow down a little bit because of the translation issues Yes Counsel but also Witness EV also slow down in your answer so that people may take notes of what you are saying let alone to hear it and to follow it Q Witness between the death of the president  death of the president and the th of April  you said the th was the date of the death of the president and the th is the date of the beginning of events In that period of time did you witness any violence in your commune A Between those two dates we did not see many acts of violence apart from some squabbling or Q And in that period between the death of the president EV and the th of April;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
you have said that your residence was near the communal office My question is the following did you in that period of time ever hear any gunshots or any firing A Yes from time to time we would hear gunshots but they werent  the firing wasnt in our commune Q Witness EV would it be correct to say without naming the place but in view of the proximity of your residence to the communal office whether  if shots were fired at the communal office you would have heard them is that not correct Yes I could have heard such firing such gunshots And you therefore confirm to us that after the death of the president until the th of April you witnessed no such gunshots no such firing from the communal office is that correct Yes it is correct You told us that on the th that the th of April was the date at which the events began that date  on that date were there already refugees from the war settled in your commune Yes there were some refugees from elsewhere Can you tell us Witness EV if you have any knowledge thereof where the refugees were settled DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY A Q It was a small number of refugees who came to live with relatives in a neighbouring secteur And during that period from the th of April to the th of April;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
Witness EV did witnesses sic come and settle at the communal office  MR PRESIDENT Did the witnesses  THE WITNESS No but that day  MR PRESIDENT English interpreter you said witnesses THE WITNESS MR BOULÃ‰  that day there were refugees If you like I shall try  I will repeat for everything to be clear THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER But I thought the witness had said no and then apparently he said yes I dont know what happened I think counsel should put the question again MR PRESIDENT Can you repeat your question Counsel You were asking about refugees at the commune at a particular time What came through in the English translation was witnesses I know it is refugees but what the English translation came through was witnesses THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER Oh Im sorry sorry MR PRESIDENT THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER It was a mistake Im sorry yes MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT If it is I who made a mistake Im sorry No I think  what did you hear I think it was a translation problem MR BOULÃ‰ I will repeat MR PRESIDENT Yes BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q Witness between the date of the death of the president and the th of April to be quite specific Im DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page A Q A Q question NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY not speaking of the th when something happened when something specific happened but before that date were there any;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
refugees at the commune commune office No there were no refugees there And still in that period between the death of the president and the th of April do you have any knowledge of any massacres whatsoever committed at the communal office Do you understand my Im not sure that I correctly understood your question Perhaps you would like to reformulate it So between the death of the president and before the th of April did you hear about have any knowledge of people being massacred or killed if you prefer that term at the communal office within the premises of the communal office A No no such thing occurred Q Witness you do go perhaps not so often but quite frequently to the communal office Do you have any knowledge that before the th of April pits were dug within the premises where it might be but around the communal office A Yes I understand your question As regards those pits there were pits And we were told that they were septic tanks for the communal office supposed to be septic tanks But those septic tanks were nonetheless used for excrement isnt it But there were other pits that werent used for that At about what date were these other pits  did Q A Q Yes you see these other pits A As regards those septic tanks septic pits that werent used I saw them after the war Before the war I only knew of one septic pit;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
at that place And after the war I saw two other pits at that place Q When you say after the war EV you mean after July is that correct Please excuse me for a second A Yes MR BOULÃ‰ BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q A Q A That septic pit the one that existed on the th of April where was it situated That pit was below the hall multipurpose hall opposite the communal office So it would be correct to say that that septic pit was not dug behind the communal jail No it wasnt between the communal jail MR PRESIDENT The question was behind Did the interpretation come through THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER Behind No it wasnt behind the communal jail THE WITNESS No it was below the multipurpose hall for shows or games and that building was opposite the main communal office building So there is no question of it being between DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q On the th of April  MR BOULÃ‰ May I continue Mr President MR PRESIDENT FEBRUARY Yes except of course with regard to the issue you are addressing the earlier English translation that came through was behind the  no between you know the jail and the communal office But I think your original question was behind I think we shall clarify because I dont think it was one or the other No no your question was very;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
clear but I think there was some problem with the translation MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT MR BOULÃ‰ Agreed BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q So Witness for everyone to understand clearly where was the pit Can you be quite precise as to A It was behind the building the multipurpose hall where shows and games took place and that Q And to be quite specific the pit was not either behind nor anywhere near the communal jail is that where it was situated building was facing the communal office correct A No it was not behind the communal jail It is true that the multipurpose hall later was used as a detention place for suspects of genocide people suspected of genocide but before the events it was a multipurpose hall it wasnt a jail Q And when you say it became a jail for people accused of genocide we are talking about after the war after July is that correct Witness EV Yes that is correct but the pit in question had been dug well before On the th of April the day you mentioned having fled can you tell us at about what time you saw A Q the acts of arson A It was in the evening of the th houses were being torched here and there and we immediately left our homes And from that moment on we tried to seek refuge elsewhere Q So Witness are you telling us you left your place your home at the th;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
in the evening or the th at night or the th in the morning Could you be more precise A In fact we wandered all night the night of the th to the th And it was on the th that we decided to leave even if we had nowhere to go Q And during that night Witness EV from the th to the th when you wandered around did you wander around with your spouse and children in the commune A Yes we were together DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY Q A And was it only your family group or had you joined a group of people who were wandering with you At that time we were still not very numerous because it was only the beginning of the events but there was also with us neighbours who had also seen what was happening and who had become afraid Q What  how many people were there in your group then Can you tell us if you were more than A We were not immediately but the next day we were more numerous but of course  but before and left their homes their households or less than it wasnt a figure of up to people no Q Do you  are you saying that when you wandered around all night until the morning you never went back to your residence before leaving on the next day A As;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
soon as we left our homes our residence it was torched so nobody went back to his home at that time Q A Are you asserting that your residence was torched in the night of the th to the th In fact when I left my residence it wasnt yet  it hadnt yet been set ablaze but I learned that as soon Q And this information when did you hear of it in the following days or when you returned to your as I had left it was torched commune after the war A No I heard of it the same day People who passed my residence saw the fire and met me on the way on the road And moreover before the end of the war I left Kibuye to go back to my home I didnt immediately go to seek refuge elsewhere Q When you left Kibuye and we will come back to this and you went back to your residence your house was already burned down and destroyed A Yes I saw that my house had been burned down and destroyed Q We will come back to this Witness EV So on the th of April you wandered around a part of the night did you have any animals or livestock at your residence A Yes Q A so Q Were those  did you take those animals or that livestock with you A No I couldnt take the cattle with me except for small animals;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
I could not take the larger animals because it was impossible And moreover I could not go farther with the small animals I had with me And to understand when you say small livestock what are you referring to Witness EV I had left the cows at home and took with me the goats but on the way people took my goats I must tell you that we were being chased all along the way Q In the morning after wandering all night at what time did you head for the communal office if you did A No in the morning we did not go to the communal office I did not go to the communal office on that day We passed by the communal office and we went on our way because other persons had been there and they had been led to believe that they would be safeguarded but in fact they were detained And when I heard that we avoided going to the communal office DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY Q When you got to the level of the communal office at what time was that if you can give us an approximate time EV A When we passed by on the road just near the communal office I believe that it was around a m We immediately continued when we heard that people had been imprisoned at the communal office We didnt waste any time We;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
didnt even seek to go to the communal office we simply went on Q Now your group of refugees at the time you passed by the communal office on that th of April and you went on your group how many were there more or less than approximately A We were quite less than that less than Q When you say Witness that that event took place on the th of April was there a particular reason that allows you to say  let me finish Witness of April Witness was there a particular reason that allows you to say that the date of your flight was the th A I said that we left our houses on the th and that we wandered around throughout the night And that on the th that you are referring to was the next day in the morning We arrived at the level of the communal office where people had been imprisoned And then we went on our way towards Gisagara We did not waste any time leaving that area We were quite few as I said Q Now Witness that is not my question What I want to know from you is how you knew that that day was the th of April and not the st not the th How did you know how could you tell of that specific date of the th of April Witness A As a matter of fact I am not sure but I believe that;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
it was on that day I really had lost  I didnt know which day it was I was lost but I believe that it was the day that I told you at least around that date because when I look at these days or those days globally I should think it was on that day It was on a Tuesday to Wednesday that the events broke out I do remember that it was on a Tuesday that the events broke out As far as the precise date is concerned I couldnt be sure Q Now Im not blaming you but if I suggest to you that in one of your statements made in you said that your flight from your house started on the th of April th April is it possible that you also said A Well if that was recorded thus I dont know but the fact is that on the th I was no longer at home the th April we were at Kibuye MR PRESIDENT Yes Counsel can you go on MR BOULÃ‰ Most obliged Mr President MR PRESIDENT Counsel we have to move things a bit faster you know your approach because you know your defence If you can address these issues that you would like to see maybe service the background of your defence case and then deal with the issues of credibility and such of the murders in a more DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
ET AL FEBRUARY focused way But we dont have to take this trek all the way through without knowing exactly which is important for the defence of the Accused person or if it is for historical detail But if you can address in a more focused way the issue you want to demonstrate before the Trial Chamber that might help first of all for the Trial Chamber to follow the issue that you want to emphasise and two to avoid details that may not be necessary perhaps in your defence and thirdly Mr President could we ask the witness to leave the courtroom so that I should be able to make some Yes Witness EV there are legal issues that counsel would like to raise with the Trial Chamber which do not concern you Can you leave for a while to move fast MR BOULÃ‰ explanations MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS MR PRESIDENT Most obliged Mr President You will be coming back shortly Witness stood down MR PRESIDENT Are we there registry MR BOULÃ‰ Yes Mr BoulÃ© if you can do it briefly we dont want to take a lot of time Go on Counsel We shall be as quick as possible What I wanted to say is that EV has testified on facts concerning which several witnesses have also  or are also going to testify Now my questions are not all geared to the sole purpose of underlying contradictions with this witness but Im sure that when we will;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
argue at the end of the testimonies elements that hold together throughout the testimonies it will be very important to compare statements of one witness against another concerning the same events This is why I believe for certain details of days locations I believe it is important I should get as much detail as possible from the witness This having been said I do not intend to delay the Court There are certain elements that would allow me to accelerate my questioning but I have details about the communal office and the commune cellule to be as clear as possible for there to be able to circumscribe events that took place during that period of time This is why I am working on this particular issue And I will move on very quickly to other things such as the flight and other issues instead of going into as much detail as I have been right now Mr President DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL MR PRESIDENT FEBRUARY Yes Counsel we do appreciate Mr BoulÃ© we do appreciate what you are trying to do And well allow you to do so Our own concern is that if you could address those specifics in a more precise and short way that might help For example why spend  what would be the reason of spending time on the wandering element if it doesnt  unless there is some specific link up to what you;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
want to raise and to demonstrate for the Trial Chamber If it is events that you want to address at the communal office go straight to them and raise them or in another matter concerning a witness who has testified it would be a question of approach rather than anything else So if you can organize your work in such a way we would like to see you demonstrate whatever you want to demonstrate but in maybe a short way but more focused way If there are matters that are not necessary then leave them out and then we move on but deal with the issues that you want to bring out before the Trial Chamber Okay can we bring the witness in Bring the witness in MR BOULÃ‰ No interpretation Witness present MR PRESIDENT Okay Mr BoulÃ© BY MR BOULÃ‰ Yes Yes Witness EV are you okay Are you comfortably seated Q Witness when on the th of April or at least the date when you left your commune when you left the commune did you at any time whatsoever in your flight hear any explosions from the parish A Yes I did hear explosions Q Was it on the same day that you left your commune Yes it was on the same day the th in the morning A Q A Q Now those explosions you heard from the parish would you say that they were grenade explosions or gunshots or other types of noises A Those were;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
grenade explosions because we realised that there was smoke from that area I am not in a position to tell you that there were also gunshots but we heard grenades exploding Q Now those grenade explosions did they come from the church that is of that area that location you mentioned yesterday without having to repeat the name Yes it came from the church And could you tell us if your recollection is there of the approximate time the approximate time of the day on the th of April that explosions started Was it in the morning or at around oclock when you left DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page A Q A Q A Q A A Q A Q NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL It was in the morning FEBRUARY You said that you passed by the communal office to  was it before you got by the communal office or after you got by the communal office that you heard the explosions I had just passed the communal office Now before that specific time did you hear any explosions on your way from the parish during the night or the day after There were no grenade explosions the day before during the night And at what specific spot were you at the time you saw smoke from the parish I had just passed the communal office I was still very near the communal office though but just Q Now for how long more did;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
you hear explosions How long after that did you continue to hear I did not monitor that I tried to hurry away During the night before your flight at any time whatsoever when you were wandering around the commune did you and your family or small group go into the parish area A We did not go into the parish area Q You are now on the way leaving the communal office heading for Gisagara Did you use the road or did you go off the road at a certain point A We did not continue on the road We went off of the road into the fields Q Yesterday in questioning  or in response to questions you said that you went by Kibuye is that passed it explosions correct That is correct Could you give us an estimation of the time that it took your group from the communal office or around the communal office to get to Kibuye how long did it take A I cannot give you an estimation of time that it took us we were walking We were on foot and we had the two children with us I could not estimate  THE WITNESS But Mr President perhaps I should be asked consistent questions because if he continues putting such little details to me it might traumatize me It is giving me some flashbacks and I cannot remember every detail MR PRESIDENT Witness try to remember what you can remember These details could;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
be important in the general run of the matter that is being addressed here So if a question is not proper the Trial Chamber will say so Where you are able to give an answer if you remember you say so you do so Where you are not able you can say so as well Counsel is asking you how long that is an estimation if you recall that it took you to walk from the area around the communal office to the Kibuye area It may appear not to be important but it could DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY be important The idea is not to traumatize the witness If there is an element of that the Trial Chamber will certainly advise counsel about that Okay can you answer that question if you are able to do it THE WITNESS Thank you Mr President hours to cover that distance BY MR BOULÃ‰ which runs the river A Yes we crossed the valley Pages to by Donna M Lewis He wanted to know the amount of time it took us I would say so far as I am concerned that I took two Q Now when you arrived at Kibuye is it correct to say that you went through the valley that is valley in DONNA M LEWIS  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL FEBRUARY Q A Q Q A Q A Q And going;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

I want to know is whether you went on your on way to Gisagara through the valley or by going up the hill or through another way am I clear A We went up to the top of Kabuye hill and then took the road leading to Gisagara Q So EV as a matter of fact the top of the hill that you went on is the same hilltop where the refugees were going to gather in the subsequent days or in the ensuing days is that correct Yes that is the same hilltop where other people had taken refuge Now let me go back to my question On that day EV  on that day that you came by with your JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL FEBRUARY group to the hilltop of Kabuye were there refugees already there at the hilltop A We did not go through the location where the refugees were We saw that there were refugees on our way back or when we returned Q Witness I am not talking about your return now I am talking about your flight to exile You passed by the commune office you went by Kabuye and you were heading for Gisagara Witness EV you have just said that you passed on top of the hill on your way to Gisagara during that MR PRESIDENT You dont have to go that far trip correct THE WITNESS Yes sir that is correct MR;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
PRESIDENT hill THE WITNESS MR BOULÃ‰ Thank you MR BOULÃ‰ correct Yes that is correct And Counsel asked you whether or not at that time there were any refugees at the top of that Kabuye I answered that those refugees came afterwards but at the time we went by I did not see any of them So you went along until Gisagara EV how long did you take to get to Gisagara approximately From Kabuye to Gisagara it is not very far It took us about minutes Is it therefore correct to say EV that your group arrived at Gisagara just before midday is that Now EV from the communal office of your commune up to Gisagara did you  was your group chased by assailants that is from the communal office to Gisagara A Wherever we went we were chased by people Q Now still on your journey from the communal office to Gisagara were there any people killed from among your group Yes especially the old that were a little bit falling back those were killed Now before that was before arriving at Gisagara Yes before we got to Gisagara And those attackers that killed those people were they people from the population or were they A It was especially the members of the population Q Were there any other people apart from the population the police the military or people armed with soldiers firearms JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page Q A Q;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

coming from various places Did your group go through Gisagara in the market place in Gisagara Yes we passed the Gisagara market Q Was the group essentially made up of people children men and women or were there also herds of cattle or livestock among the people who were fleeing A It was a group of men women children and some livestock Q Would it be correct Witness EV that certain people even had large livestock with them Yes that is correct And when we say  mean large livestock we mean cattle with horns either cows or oxen JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page A Q Q A A Q A Q Q A Q A Q A Q A Q A Q A Q FEBRUARY Did your group stop at Gisagara or did you go on without stopping And where did your group of people stop at Gisagara near the market or somewhere else Are we to understand then Witness EV your group was quite large and filled the entire market place NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL Yes that is correct A We stopped first At the market place at Gisagara Yes that is correct have lasted That halt or that pause in Gisagara lasted how long How long do you estimate it Witness EV to A We stayed there until the evening and it was in the evening that we left that place Q Witness as the notion of evening in Rwanda is different from;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
evening in other countries are you speaking of the afternoon or after the setting of the sun The sun had just set So it would be correct to say Witness EV that if you arrived at Gisagara at about noon and you left at sunset that you stayed at Gisagara for about six hours is that an acceptable estimate A Yes your estimate is correct because the sousprÃ©fet promised to defend us and since we did not have faith in him we did not trust him We decided to leave but there were people who were Q So Witness EV according to your testimony we are to understand that the sousprÃ©fet came to speak to you when you had halted at Gisagara is that what we are to understand observing us Yes that is correct So did the prÃ©fet  sousprÃ©fet come alone or was he accompanied by other people of authority communal policemen conseiller soldiers or elected officials Was there anyone else On that day when he spoke to us he was in the company of soldiers that I did not know And by soldiers you are referring to a person bearing weapons who is different from a communal Are you able to tell us Witness EV approximately how many such soldiers accompanied the A As to the soldiers accompanying the sousprÃ©fet there were three of the people but you could see And for the record when we are referring to  talking of the sousprÃ©fet we are talking;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

that into two we have around metres  around metres metres MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT Shall we all agree on metres would you agree Counsel Maybe that being the distance from where the witness was and between him and the sousprÃ©fet Yes Mr President I understand what you said now and I agree with that distance Q Witness when the sousprÃ©fet Dominic came to meet your group did he arrive on foot or by vehicle At that time he was  when I saw him he was on foot He wasnt in a car  in a vehicle And the group left the place immediately afterwards the sousprÃ©fet speech or did sometime pass before the group of people who were in all these  You said prÃ©fet instead of sousprÃ©fet learned colleague Let me start again I dont want to offend any sensibilities We are talking of the sousprÃ©fet I will put my question again if the Trial Chamber so allows JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL FEBRUARY MR PRESIDENT Yes Counsel BY MR BOULÃ‰ to fall thats when we left understand away  forced to leave Q Witness  when  at what time did the sousprÃ©fet make his speech and how long after did you leave Could you answer that question even if it is a twopart question A He made a speech in the afternoon and we discussed a bit before leaving and when the night began Q Witness EV;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
when you left is it correct to say that you werent being chased away from that place but that you left voluntarily because you did not trust what the sousprÃ©fet said is that what we have to A Yes it was on our own initiative But in as much as we were surrounded by assailants and who werent very far away from us they were trying to grab us So we cant say that we were chased Q The sousprÃ©fet Dominics speech can you tell us what he said if you still recollect it A Well as to his speech I will tell you what I remember It wasnt a very long speech He told us â€œWhere are you going Who is chasing you â€ We told him what our problems were and he said â€œStay here first there are many soldiers here who will protect you ensure your safety securityâ€ but as we told him that we were being followed by assailants and as he just said to the assailants encircle the refugees and the soldiers were there and did nothing to repel the assailants Thats why we took the initiative to leave rather than to be killed on the spot Yes Counsel Witness RV slow down a bit in your answer Okay Right MR PRESIDENT Go on Counsel BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q Witness in your entire group of refugees of several thousand of people now were there any leaders No there were no leaders How then was the;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

that I did not know And the people who were inside the double cabin vehicle were they uniformed or were they in civilian clothing Is the question clear Both there were civilians and soldiers Now the vehicle which was in front of that convey was it the military vehicle or the white vehicle belonging to the commune It was the white vehicle of the commune sir That white vehicle was it a double cabin vehicle too JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page Q A A Q A Q A Q A Q Q A Q A Q A Q NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL FEBRUARY A Q A Q A Q Q A Q A Q A Q To your recollection without mentioning them if it may reveal your identification did the vehicle bear No sir it was a single cabin vehicle any markings A It was written communal office Q Who was in the cabin of that vehicle marked communal office A I am sorry it was not communal office that was inscribed it was simply commune Commune only the word commune and then the name of the communal It didnt say communal office It said communal and then the name of the commune Q Now when this vehicle went by near you EV were you able to see  were you looking at the door of the passenger or the door of the driver Yes Now as this was an alternative question your yes didnt answer;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
my question When the vehicle came by were you looking at the drivers door or at passenger door I am referring to the white vehicle The vehicle came by and I was on the side of the passenger door not the drivers door So that it is correct to say EV that the letters you saw you only saw on the door or on the side of the passenger is that correct A The exact placement of the writings were there I saw I knew the vehicle I knew the occupants I knew the vehicle I didnt worry about exactly where the writings were I knew that vehicle much before so I didnt worry about where the writing were placed Are you therefore saying that the writings were on the passenger door No I didnt look at that detail I am very sorry Thank you Now let us come back to the question of the occupants who were in the cabin of that A In the cabin of that vehicle there was Shaho who was the driver and Elie Ndayambaje However in the next vehicle  now I remember a little detail On the first day it was Ndayambaje that was driving the first vehicle and Dominic was seated besides him Charles was probably driving the green vehicle because I saw them when the vehicle turned around after having intercepted us and ordered us to turn back I couldnt observe them when they went through but when they came back;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004
I was able to vehicle see them Q Now EV so that we are clear in this courtroom now the first vehicle that was the front vehicle that was the white vehicle was occupied by Ndayambaje and the sousprÃ©fet Ndawukuriryayo is that correct Is this what you are saying Yes this is what I am saying And who was driving Ntawukiriryayo or Ndayambaje who was driving It was Ndayambaje who was driving the vehicle And the second vehicle  now you are saying that it was probably driven that was by Shaho that is the driver you named  called Shaho A That is correct JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUHO ET AL FEBRUARY Q Now let us come back to the first vehicle driven by Ndayambaje with the sousprÃ©fet Now in the rear cabin of that white or the rear cage of that white vehicle were there people Commodities or goods A There were people in the rear I said that some of those people I did not know and I should like to add that in all those vehicles there were people In all those vehicles were full of people Q Now for more clarity EV in the first vehicle in  that is the first vehicle in the rear cage you said that you saw people that you could identify and that you could name is that correct That is correct A Q rear cage Could you be as kind as to;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

back to the part of the night you spent there from the first to the second day could the refugees stay on the same spot or they had to move around to hide to dissimilate themselves behind A On that hill one cannot move around to hide since there were so many attackers the refugees had to stay among themselves stay together and probably move around themselves Q Now at the time your family arrived there could you say that you your wife and your children stayed hills or something in this same spot A As a matter of fact the women and children we always made sure that they stayed at a given spot and we were the ones who tried to shield them to move around to shield them We were able to  we were the ones that were able to pick up stones and throw them at attackers to protect our children and wives even if we were to die they would be alive   us Q Now that first night that you spent in Kabuye Witness EV do you remember refugees lighting fire on A Refugees lit fire because when we were being shot at some of our cattle died and the refugees ate Kabuye hill the meat they had no alternative The attackers on their side did they light any fires The attackers also on their side had people backing them in their rear and they lit fire they took some of our;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002353/2;ICTR-98-42;26.04.2004

the French  speaking interpreters we will be on paragraph of that page lines to I am sorry line  from line onwards and in the English version in the English version its K It is the third paragraph from lines to At WITNESS EV CROSSEXAMINATION continued Q Witness you have your statement in Kinyarwanda The code number  the reference number doesnt A That is the document I have before me I have a document in French but I do not understand French Mr President I have a document in Kinyarwanda but I do not understand Kinyarwanda so that I couldnt tell him the page where the passage I am pointing to is in French There is a Kinyarwanda document do you have it Mr BoulÃ© Its K in Kinyarwanda apparently that is the code Mr President I am trying to find for the information of the witness the place We have it it is page in the Kinyarwandan document with K from the second line that is JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY for the Kinyarwanda document MR BOULÃ‰ I thank the interpreter BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q Now Witness I am reading out the passage of the statement concerning the issue I want to raise You said â€œIn Kabuye they brought in assailants from all over and bourgmestre Elie Ndayambaje distributed grenades to the workers and all those who knew how to use grenades They then started the carnage which;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
lasted for four days I was there and even Ndayambajes policemen who were shooting them down were unable to overcome that human tide Fortunately it rained that Sunday night and some of them were able to escape  It ends by saying that Those who did not succeed in escaping were exterminated all along the road  The last sentence says That was all I was able to see â€ Is it correct to say Witness that this is what you said so far as Kabuye was concerned in this statement of  A I have the impression that my statement was not correctly recorded It was not recorded such as I made it because here it is said that I said that he came in with his staff I am referring to the people that came in with him in the same vehicle Q Now Witness I should also like us to underscore the fact that at no time here did you say that A Q Ndayambaje was among the crowd and that he had a weapon isnt that correct I believe that during my statement here  during my testimony here I did tell you that Yes I am not talking about your testimony here in Arusha Your testimony here was heard by the Rwandans and all of us I am asking you whether in the statements of the  you did say that Ndayambaje had a weapon and that he shot at refugees and since this doesnt;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
appear in your statement this is what I am trying to point out to you A I believe I did mention that probably those that recorded my statement wrote whatever they wanted to write or perhaps they had other purposes Q Thank you I shall move on to another point Witness I should like then to show you your statement of the th of October MR BOULÃ‰ THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER in French again MR PRESIDENT say MR BOULÃ‰ And for clarity we have three documents Mr President one document in Kinyarwanda that could be shown to the witness K th of October English version Could counsel repeat because he changed languages and his microphone wasnt on where he started The English interpreter would like you Mr BoulÃ© to repeat because you changed languages they The English is K and the French document is coded K JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL BY MR BOULÃ‰ FEBRUARY Q Witness that statement of the th of October that you recognised yesterday after having been shown to you in Kinyarwanda its a very short one As far as Kabuye is concerned the two lines say  THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER BY MR BOULÃ‰ The interpreter hasnt found it yet This is a free translation We are talking about Ndayambaje and the documents â€œAnd finally another thing it was he that supplied Kabuye where we had taken refuge  supplied Kabuye with grenadesâ€ Do you remember having made this;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
statement your second statement of the  Witness EV Yes I did make such a statement A Q And Witness is it also true that the statement  in this statement you never said that Ndayambaje in Kabuye did shoot or did carry a weapon during that event you never said he carried a weapon You never said he shot A Now sometimes I was asked questions that I was in the least expecting and at the time I was busy doing something else so that I wouldnt have the time to say everything I wanted to say so that I was taken by surprise It was impossible for me to say all that I wanted to say Q Thank you very much Witness I should now move on to another document I should now like you to see your statement of the  on which you have your initials and your signature on the English that is the original document The parts that I shall read out to you will be translated by the interpreter in view of the fact that there is no Kinyarwanda original version I  for more clarity we will refer you to the English page K that is the first paragraph for the Englishspeaking and the French version is K paragraph  I am sorry second paragraph I should like to point out Witness and if you want we can go through the declaration as a whole  the statement as a whole In;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
this statement you abundantly talked about Kabuye The only paragraph where you talk about Elie Ndayambaje is a paragraph I shall read out to you MR MOSES I think thats an interpretation of what is in the  I think its for the Witness to decide whether or not other paragraphs refer to Elie Ndayambaje I am satisfied with my friends putting to the witness that the paragraph I think he intends to refer to is the only paragraph which specifically refers to Elie Ndayambaje There are other paragraphs which may or may not refer to him MR BOULÃ‰ Mr President this is the only paragraph in the statement which specifically refers to Ndayambajes behaviour in Kabuye and I am sure my learned friend would accept that from that vantaged point It is on this specific point that I want to refer to I am not going to talk about the fact that the witness didnt talk about the hill in all the other circumstances I am going to refer specifically to Ndayambaje and it is this paragraph that talks about what he did JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT the  okay go ahead Counsel BY MR BOULÃ‰ And this is the reason why I am referring you to this particular paragraph Mr Moses Mr Moses do you have any problem Whats  do you have any further submission We dont have FEBRUARY Q Witness I should read;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
out in English the portion of your statement because it is thus that it was recorded by the investigators I am reading the English text He arrived there in his Toyota I saw him arriving on the adjacent hill everyday  Interpreter I hope you clarify that it says Adjacent hill But he also  I didnt have any translation Mr President Translation of what In English we just  if you can go back to where you said I saw him arrive on the adjacent hill I didnt get what followed next after that What happened Mr President was that when I read that sentence in English I was listening to the French translation and the translation in French said I saw him arriving from the neighbouring hill and not arriving at the neighbouring hill This is why I wanted the interpreter to make the correction which the interpreter did I thank the interpreter for that Q We were at the line which says He also brought some more killers additional Interehamwe Apparently he wanted to proceed with the killings faster because we were so many The shooting lasted for five days but it intensified during the last three days Additionally he brought additional Interahamwe killers I saw that Elie pointed out the positions of the shooters who were to be replaced The very first day I saw that Elie supplied arms and ammunition and traditional weapons to the Hutu Witness what you have stated in relation to what;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
Elie Ndayambaje did at Kabuye is that a truth A I wasnt speaking the same language with the investigator Some other things are indeed what I said but some things are not or missing I dont know if the statement was taken in French or in English There seems to be things that have been left out but other elements seem to be much what I said to JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT MR BOULÃ‰ MR PRESIDENT Go on Counsel MR BOULÃ‰ Thank you BY MR BOULÃ‰ civilians  representation NYIRAMASUHUKO ET AL the investigator Pages to by Judith Kapatamoyo FEBRUARY JUDITH KAPATAMOYO  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL H MR BOULÃ‰ BY MR BOULÃ‰ I am sorry for speaking too soon interrupting the interpretation FEBRUARY MR BOULÃ‰ BY MR BOULÃ‰ A Q Q A Q This statement was taken by Tribunal investigators who had an official interpreter who wrote down what you said on paper There are certificates   certification in French and Kinyarwanda stating that the statement was read back to you and you signified your satisfaction and that it was indeed an actual reflection of what you said Thats correct And nowhere does it state that Elie Ndayambaje was seen by you armed and shooting at people As a matter of fact Mr President the few statements that we have in our possession nowhere does it state that Elie Ndayambaje was armed;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
and shooting at people Is it a mistake of the investigators who erred in taking down your statement I think it is the investigatorsâ€™ fault because I always consistently said that I saw Ndayambaje shooting So if they didnt write it down whereas I couldnt see what they were writing I said that the investigators erred and very often we saw that some judicial police inspectors who were corrupted who came to see witnesses and instead of writing down what the witnesses said wrote down what Q Are to understand Witness in what circumstances corrupted investigators who went to see witnesses they wanted to make false statements A I said judicial police judicial police or what they call in Rwanda IPJ the judicial police inspectors at the communal level sometimes they lock people up and then you find they have escaped and gone into exile I will give you an example We have often talked about statements by judicial police inspectors Elies younger brother was released in some mysterious way and allowed to go into exile whereas he was jailed in the a communal jail which proves that certain judicial police inspectors come and question you and dont write what you tell them and prefer to write it in a language you dont Q Witness we are not going to come back to the problems of imprisonment in Rwanda two of the statements we are talking about which were taken by investigators from the Tribunal and not judicial The translation;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
came through that two statements were taken by the investigators There is only one understand police inspectors MR MOSES that I am aware of MR PRESIDENT MR BOULÃ‰ I think that was the opposite Mr BoulÃ© said PETRUS CHIJARIRA  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY I am sorry Mr President I am sorry two were taken by judicial police inspectors and one by a Tribunal investigator a Tribunal investigator MR PRESIDENT Yes Counsel MR BOULÃ‰ Thank you BY MR BOULÃ‰ MR MOSES adjacent to MR BOULÃ‰ Q I will continue with another extract I wish to materialise the same paragraph that I have just read to you Witness When you read it from the beginning you state He arrived there in his Toyota I saw him arriving on the adjacent hill everyday  Witness you have told us here in this Trial Chamber that every day that Ndayambaje came he didnt go to the adjacent hill but to Kabuye hill My learned friend he has to leave the statement as it is written It doesnt say in the statement and in fact he should ask the witness what he meant by adjacent hill because nowhere in the statement does it say what was adjacent to or what or who it was adjacent to Another point my friend I think he is entitled to ask what the witness means when he said adjacent hill but for my friend to interpret in one way may or;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
may not be the way in which the witness interpreters or in fact Your Honours may interpret the statement It doesnt say the statement a hill adjacent to Kabuye hill For example it just says an adjacent hill without saying whatâ€™s the hill was Mr President we could have some linguistic and semantic arguments that would last quite a bit of time but if say someone came to the neighbouring house it is not the same thing as saying someone came to my house adjacent or neighbouring refers to something that is beside I think the terms are clear It is what the witness states in his statement It is what I am pointing out How many times have I asked the question if you allow me to finish business and to move it I asked him several times in the course of crossexamination yesterday if it is Ndayambaje coming to the neighbouring adjacent hills either one or the other and Mr President   and I think my questions were to sufficiently clear and sufficiently repetitive for each of the days in question So if the witness had wanted to mention or point out that Ndayambaje came to an adjacent hill he could have said so His statement is clear and the Bench will interpret Mr Moses I leave you the floor MR MOSES Adjacent and neighbouring they are two different concepts Something can be adjacent to a person doesnt necessarily mean  and it is simply unclear from;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
the statement in my submission and the witness should be asked what he meant by that If he says a neighbouring hill then of course my friend is entitled to put what has been said earlier in his evidence but its not I think the witness should be asked what he meant by that whether that is correct rather my friend interpreting it in one PETRUS CHIJARIRA  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY fashion and saying that this is what you have said We should not go further than on that question We recall the evidence of this witness talked about here with regard to this issue and I think he is in a position to answer this question Thank you Mr President In view of the question and the French version of the statement I didnt speak of the neighbouring hill and a hill neighbouring Kabuye I talked about Kibuye hill And I said it yesterday twice There is a place between Kabuye and Dahwe I do not know if that is the place that they are referring to by speaking of the adjacent hill It is a place called Kundatemwa which is just at the beginning of Kabuye hill Kundatemwa I will spell it KUNDATEMWA MR BOULÃ‰ Mr President  MR PRESIDENT THE WITNESS Go on Counsel The question is there KUNDATEMWA MR PRESIDENT Yes MR BOULÃ‰ BY MR BOULÃ‰ Allow me Mr President to continue Q Witness would you assert that;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
the investigators who took your statements misinterpreted you saying I saw him arriving on the adjacent hill everyday I saw him arriving on Kabuye hill  A Listen I will explain to you In the French they speak of Kabuye hill and in the English version they speak of the neighbouring hill Why is there that distinction Why is that different It is not me who wrote the French version MR BOULÃ‰ Mr President allow me I dont know all of a sudden the witness understands French but certainly it would appear that his knowledge of languages has greatly improved I will read the French I saw Elie every day He came in his Toyota I saw him come every day under a la colline  I think this point has now been established and we can go on to something else MR PRESIDENT But  but the English interpreter talked about that what is that colline when you are interpreting the French element of what Mr BoulÃ© THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER A la colline viosine laterally means the neighbouring hill the adjacent hill MR BOULÃ‰ That is the reason why the witness just said that in the French version the sentence was asserted that it not la colline voisine but Kabuye hill I should to like things to be clear on this point PETRUS CHIJARIRA  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY Thank you MR PRESIDENT Go on Counsel BY MR BOULÃ‰ Q Witness I;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
am still on the same document the statement made to the Tribunal investigators the page being the Knumber in English K French version K last paragraph in both instances Witness I will read you the whole paragraph for everything to be clear to you and as it was taken the English is the original so I shall read it in English I spent five days on that hill in Kabuye There was a huge crowd of people on the hill The soldiers and policemen started shooting into the crowd from everywhere I also saw that some soldiers were posted on adjacent hills I saw at least three fixed position of soldiers firing at us They also fired grenades into the crowds of refugees I saw them shooting rifles There were also Hutu civilians who fired with rifles and who threw grenades at us I saw people falling down everywhere Many got killed I also say that many people fell into a river down at Dahwe They were killed with pangas and spears by the local Hutu civilians  And then I come to the point that concerns and that interests me I started in the morning and lasted until sunset In the evening the soldiers and the Hutu civilians were surveying the areas to prevent us from escaping  Witness do you remember having made this statement and giving the information in parts Yes I remember A Q you said this at all You say Witness that the shooting lasted;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
five days from morning to night Your testimony here before the Trial Chamber was that the shooting went down night and day day and night for five days Are we to understand that the investigators who took your statement incorrectly noted your  what A When I made statement to the investigators I told them that they were shooting all the time I do not know why they said that they were shooting at night If there had been no shooting the refugees could have escaped because there were people keeping watch over the refugees I dont understand Q You said that if they didnt shoot at night some people could have escaped I will read the following lines â€œSome People succeeded to escape at night  I think that there is a mistake in the translation between the French and the English but as the original was English we can conclude that a word is missing in the French translation But which sentence where MR PRESIDENT MR BOULÃ‰ MR MOSES succeeded to escape at night  I dont understand what is happening now We must note that any English says Some people PETRUS CHIJARIRA  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY There is one word you missed out at the beginning of the English Nevertheless some people managed to  some people succeeded to escape at night  The word nevertheless didnt come Mr President wait in French in the French says neanmoins so;1;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
that is nevertheless Some people succeeded in escaping But the French omits the words at night That is the deference between the two And I think that the bearing of the sentence is that if thus the witness says if the shooting stopped at night people succeeded in escaping And now that point is established I think I can go on Q Witness we are going to finish very shortly my crossexamination but I must apologise to the public I need a closed session I need some information of confidence to obtain some information of a We will go into closed session to enable counsel to raise questions with the witness some of which could have a bearing on his identity We could request the public to leave at this stage of the At this point in the proceedings a portion of the transcript pages to  was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera Pages to by Petrus Chijarira across MR PRESIDENT Okay Counsel MR BOULÃ‰ to something else MR PRESIDENT Lets go on Counsel MR BOULÃ‰ Thank you Mr President BY MR BOULÃ‰ confidential nature MR PRESIDENT proceedings PETRUS CHIJARIRA  ICTR  TRIAL CHAMBER II  page NYIRIMASUHUKO ET AL FEBRUARY MR PRESIDENT Registry MR KIYEYEU Yes My Lord MR PRESIDENT We will stop here for today As we said yesterday next Monday next Monday on Tuesday we will be sitting only in the morning We will start at  a;0;3;Witness EV;TRA002352/1;ICTR-98-42;27.04.2004
